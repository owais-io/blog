## üöÄ Understanding Bash Variables

Variables in bash are containers that store data values. They make your scripts flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain. Instead of repeating the same value throughout your script, you can store it in a variable and reference it whenever needed.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 dark:from-blue-900 dark:to-indigo-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

### Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have:
- Completed the [Creating Your First Bash Script](https://owais.io/blog/creating-your-first-bash-script) tutorial
- Basic understanding of bash script execution
- Access to a Linux terminal

</div>

## üìù Creating Your First Variable Script

Let's start by creating a simple script that demonstrates variable usage:

```bash
touch using_variables.sh
chmod +x using_variables.sh
```

<Callout type="success">
‚úÖ **Pro Tip**: Notice how we're making the script executable right after creating it. This saves time and prevents the common "Permission denied" error.
</Callout>

Now let's add some content to our script:

```bash title="using_variables.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash
NAME="Alice"
echo "Hello $NAME!"
```

When we execute this script:

```bash
$ ./using_variables.sh
Hello Alice!
```

## üèóÔ∏è Variable Declaration and Assignment

### Basic Variable Assignment

In bash, variables are assigned without spaces around the equals sign:

```bash title="variable-examples.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# Correct way to assign variables
NAME="Alice"
AGE=25
CITY="New York"

# Using the variables
echo "Name: $NAME"
echo "Age: $AGE"
echo "City: $CITY"
```

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">

<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg border border-red-200 dark:border-red-700">

#### ‚ùå Common Mistakes
```bash
# Wrong - spaces around =
NAME = "Alice"

# Wrong - using $ in assignment
$NAME = "Alice"

# Wrong - inconsistent quotes
NAME = 'Alice"
```

</div>

<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg border border-green-200 dark:border-green-700">

#### ‚úÖ Correct Syntax
```bash
# Right - no spaces
NAME="Alice"

# Right - no $ in assignment
NAME="Alice"

# Right - consistent quotes
NAME="Alice"
```

</div>

</div>

### Variable Naming Conventions

<Callout type="info">
üìù **Best Practices for Variable Names**:
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables and constants
- Use lowercase for local script variables
- Use underscores to separate words
- Start with a letter or underscore, not a number
- Avoid special characters except underscores
</Callout>

```bash title="naming-conventions.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# Constants and environment-like variables
DATABASE_URL="localhost:5432"
MAX_RETRIES=3

# Local script variables
user_name="bob"
file_count=10
temp_directory="/tmp/myapp"

echo "Database: $DATABASE_URL"
echo "User: $user_name"
echo "Files: $file_count"
```

## üîÑ Modifying Variables Dynamically

Let's see how we can change variable values during script execution:

```bash title="dynamic-variables.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# Initial assignment
NAME="Alice"
echo "Hello $NAME!"

# Changing the variable
NAME="Bob"
echo "Hello $NAME!"

# You can also assign based on other variables
GREETING="Hello"
FULL_MESSAGE="$GREETING $NAME!"
echo "$FULL_MESSAGE"
```

Output:
```bash
$ ./dynamic-variables.sh
Hello Alice!
Hello Bob!
Hello Bob!
```

This demonstrates the dynamic nature of variables - you can modify them at any point in your script, just like we did in our terminal session.

## üéØ Variable Substitution Methods

Bash offers several ways to use variables in your scripts:

### Basic Variable Substitution

```bash title="substitution-examples.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

NAME="Alice"
AGE=30

# Method 1: Direct substitution
echo "Hello $NAME"

# Method 2: Braced substitution (recommended)
echo "Hello ${NAME}"

# Method 3: When concatenating
echo "Hello ${NAME}123"  # Clear separation
echo "Hello $NAME123"    # This would look for variable NAME123!
```

<Callout type="warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Use braces `${VAR}` when concatenating variables with other text to avoid confusion about where the variable name ends.
</Callout>

### Advanced Substitution Techniques

```bash title="advanced-substitution.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

FILENAME="document.txt"

# Get the length of a variable
echo "Filename length: ${#FILENAME}"

# Substring extraction
echo "First 3 characters: ${FILENAME:0:3}"
echo "Extension: ${FILENAME: -3}"

# Default values
echo "User: ${USER_NAME:-'Anonymous'}"  # Use 'Anonymous' if USER_NAME is unset

# Case conversion (Bash 4+)
GREETING="hello world"
echo "Uppercase: ${GREETING^^}"
echo "Lowercase: ${GREETING,,}"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Examples

### Example 1: Configuration Script

```bash title="config-example.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration variables
SERVER_NAME="web-server-01"
PORT=8080
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups"

# Display configuration
echo "=== Server Configuration ==="
echo "Server Name: $SERVER_NAME"
echo "Port: $PORT"
echo "Log Level: $LOG_LEVEL"
echo "Backup Directory: $BACKUP_DIR"

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
echo "Creating backup directory: $BACKUP_DIR"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Generate a log file name
LOG_FILE="${BACKUP_DIR}/${SERVER_NAME}_$(date +%Y%m%d).log"
echo "Log file: $LOG_FILE"
```

### Example 2: File Processing Script

```bash title="file-processor.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# File processing variables
INPUT_DIR="/home/user/documents"
OUTPUT_DIR="/home/user/processed"
FILE_EXTENSION=".txt"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Create output directory
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"

echo "Processing files from: $INPUT_DIR"
echo "Output directory: $OUTPUT_DIR"
echo "Looking for files with extension: $FILE_EXTENSION"
echo "Process timestamp: $TIMESTAMP"

# Example of using variables in a loop context
COUNTER=0
for file in "${INPUT_DIR}"/*"${FILE_EXTENSION}"; do
    if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then
        COUNTER=$((COUNTER + 1))
        echo "Processing file $COUNTER: $(basename "$file")"
    fi
done

echo "Processed $COUNTER files"
```

## üîç Variable Scope and Environment

### Local vs Environment Variables

```bash title="scope-example.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# Local variable (only available in this script)
LOCAL_VAR="I'm local"

# Environment variable (available to child processes)
export GLOBAL_VAR="I'm global"

# Display current shell's variables
echo "Local: $LOCAL_VAR"
echo "Global: $GLOBAL_VAR"

# Call another script or command that inherits GLOBAL_VAR
# The called process won't see LOCAL_VAR but will see GLOBAL_VAR
```

### Reading System Environment Variables

```bash title="system-vars.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# Using built-in environment variables
echo "Current user: $USER"
echo "Home directory: $HOME"
echo "Current directory: $PWD"
echo "Shell: $SHELL"
echo "Path: $PATH"

# Using variables in conditions
if [[ "$USER" == "root" ]]; then
    echo "Running as root user"
else
    echo "Running as regular user: $USER"
fi
```

## üö® Common Pitfalls and Solutions

<details>
<summary><strong>Spaces in Variable Assignment</strong></summary>

**Problem**: `NAME = "Alice"` gives "command not found"
**Cause**: Bash interprets this as running a command called `NAME`
**Solution**: Remove spaces: `NAME="Alice"`

```bash
# Wrong
NAME = "Alice"  # Error: command not found

# Correct
NAME="Alice"    # Works perfectly
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Using $ in Assignment</strong></summary>

**Problem**: `$NAME="Alice"` doesn't work as expected
**Cause**: The `$` is only for accessing variables, not assigning them
**Solution**: Don't use `$` when assigning: `NAME="Alice"`

```bash
# Wrong
$NAME="Alice"   # Syntax error

# Correct
NAME="Alice"    # Assignment
echo "$NAME"    # Access with $
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Unquoted Variables with Spaces</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Variables containing spaces cause word splitting
**Cause**: Unquoted variables are split on whitespace
**Solution**: Always quote variables when using them

```bash
FILE_NAME="my document.txt"

# Wrong - will be treated as multiple arguments
rm $FILE_NAME

# Correct - treated as single argument
rm "$FILE_NAME"
```

</details>

## üß™ Testing Your Understanding

Create a script that demonstrates variable usage:

```bash title="practice-script.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# Personal information
FIRST_NAME="John"
LAST_NAME="Doe"
FULL_NAME="$FIRST_NAME $LAST_NAME"

# System information
CURRENT_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
HOSTNAME=$(hostname)

# Display information
echo "=== Personal Information ==="
echo "First Name: $FIRST_NAME"
echo "Last Name: $LAST_NAME"
echo "Full Name: $FULL_NAME"

echo ""
echo "=== System Information ==="
echo "Date: $CURRENT_DATE"
echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
echo "User: $USER"

# Demonstrate variable modification
echo ""
echo "=== Variable Modification ==="
COUNTER=1
echo "Counter starts at: $COUNTER"

COUNTER=$((COUNTER + 1))
echo "Counter after increment: $COUNTER"

COUNTER=$((COUNTER * 10))
echo "Counter after multiplication: $COUNTER"
```

## üéØ Key Takeaways

<div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-green-50 to-blue-50 dark:from-green-900 dark:to-blue-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">

### ‚úÖ Remember These Points

1. **No Spaces in Assignment**: Always use `VAR="value"`, never `VAR = "value"`
2. **Quote Your Variables**: Use `"$VAR"` to prevent word splitting and preserve spaces
3. **Use Braces for Clarity**: Prefer `${VAR}` when concatenating with other text
4. **Naming Convention**: UPPERCASE for constants, lowercase for local variables
5. **Environment vs Local**: Use `export` to make variables available to child processes

Ready to master Git branching? After learning [how to push and pull changes](/blog/2025-09-30_git-push-pull-synchronization-complete-guide), it's time to explore one of Git's most powerful features: branching. This tutorial follows a real terminal session with detailed explanations of creating, switching, and managing branches both locally and on GitHub.

<Callout type="info">
üéØ **What You'll Learn**: In this comprehensive guide, you'll discover:
- Understanding what Git branches are and why they're essential
- Creating new local branches with git branch
- Switching between branches safely with git checkout
- Making commits on different branches independently
- Pushing local branches to GitHub remote repositories
- Understanding upstream tracking for branches
- Pulling remote branches to your local machine
- Creating local branches from remote branches
- Synchronizing branch changes between local and remote
- Best practices for branch management and naming conventions

**Prerequisites**: [Understanding of Git push/pull operations](/blog/2025-09-30_git-push-pull-synchronization-complete-guide) and a GitHub repository
</Callout>

## üå≥ Understanding Git Branches

### What Are Branches?

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 dark:from-blue-900 dark:to-indigo-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Git Branch**: An independent line of development that allows you to work on features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

**Real-World Analogy**: Think of branches like **parallel universes** in your project. You can create a new universe (branch) to experiment with changes, and if things go well, you can merge that universe back into the main timeline. If not, you can simply discard it without affecting the original.

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Isolation**: Work on features without breaking the main code
- ‚úÖ **Experimentation**: Try new ideas safely
- ‚úÖ **Collaboration**: Multiple developers work on different features simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **Organization**: Separate production code from development work

</div>

### Current Repository Status

Let's start by examining our repository's current state:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Initial Repository Status"
[02:41:59 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git branch
* master
```

**Command Explanation:**
- `git branch` - Lists all local branches in your repository
- ***** (asterisk) - Indicates the currently active branch
- **master** - The default primary branch in this repository

**Current State**: We only have one branch (master) and we're currently on it.

### Viewing Commit History

Let's see what commits exist in our repository:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking Commit History"
[02:43:35 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git log
commit 8c331caa10309fcb76a8cbd38c4f2e8cbff80b64 (HEAD -> master, hello/master)
Author: Owais Abbasi <81351747+owais-io@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 30 23:47:49 2025 +0500

    Update second.txt on github

commit 4a130bb7b63436556220809afcaefe58260d7c45
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 30 23:43:25 2025 +0500

    updated second.txt

commit a38542e836ebbc1e75179c3b6b6c064efb72b8cd
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 30 23:30:38 2025 +0500

    updated first.txt and added second.txt

commit 303fea0985b17714f6f3ed934684a653e11c6578
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 30 23:28:12 2025 +0500

    added first.txt
```

**Log Analysis:**
- **HEAD -> master** - Your local branch pointer
- **hello/master** - Remote branch reference (GitHub)
- **Commit history**: Four commits showing the project's evolution
- **Both pointers at same commit**: Local and remote are synchronized

## üî® Creating Your First Branch

### The Branch Creation Command

Let's create a new branch for development work:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Creating a New Branch"
[02:43:40 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git branch dev
[02:43:46 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git branch
  dev
* master
```

**Command Breakdown:**
- `git branch dev` - Creates a new branch named "dev"
- **No output** - Success is silent in Git
- **Verification**: `git branch` shows both branches now exist

**Important Understanding:**
- Creating a branch does **NOT** switch to it automatically
- The new branch starts from the **current commit** you're on
- Both branches currently point to the same commit

<Callout type="info">
üí° **Branch Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names like `feature/login`, `bugfix/payment`, `dev`, `staging`, etc. Keep names lowercase with hyphens or slashes for separation.
</Callout>

### Verifying Repository Status

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking Status After Branch Creation"
[02:43:52 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'hello/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Status Breakdown:**
- **On branch master** - Still on the master branch
- **Up to date with 'hello/master'** - Synchronized with GitHub
- **Clean working tree** - No uncommitted changes

## üîÑ Switching Between Branches

### The Checkout Command

Let's switch to our new dev branch:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Switching to Dev Branch"
[02:43:56 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git checkout dev
Switched to branch 'dev'

[02:44:03 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git status
On branch dev
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Command Explanation:**
- `git checkout dev` - Switches your working directory to the dev branch
- **"Switched to branch 'dev'"** - Confirmation message
- **Status changes**: Now shows "On branch dev"

**What Happens During Checkout:**
1. Git updates your working directory files to match the branch
2. HEAD pointer moves to the new branch
3. Future commits will be made on this branch

<Callout type="warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always commit or stash your changes before switching branches. Uncommitted changes can cause conflicts or be lost when switching.
</Callout>

## üìù Working on a New Branch

### Creating Content on Dev Branch

Let's add a new file to our dev branch:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Adding New File on Dev Branch"
[02:44:06 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ vim third.txt
[02:44:59 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ cat third.txt
working
```

**Steps Performed:**
- Created and edited `third.txt` using vim
- Added content: "working"
- **Important**: This file exists only in our working directory, not yet tracked by Git

### Checking File Status

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking Status of New File"
[02:45:01 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git status
On branch dev
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	third.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

**Status Analysis:**
- **On branch dev** - Confirms we're on the dev branch
- **Untracked files**: Git sees `third.txt` but isn't tracking it yet
- **Helpful hint**: Git suggests using `git add` to track the file

### Staging and Committing on Dev Branch

```bash title="Terminal Session: Committing on Dev Branch"
[02:45:25 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git add .
[02:45:26 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git commit -m "added third.txt"
[dev 87de0f7] added third.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 third.txt

[02:45:34 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git status
On branch dev
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Commit Analysis:**
- **[dev 87de0f7]** - Shows branch name and commit hash
- **1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)** - Summary of changes
- **create mode 100644** - File permissions set
- **Clean working tree**: All changes committed successfully

## üìä Understanding Branch Divergence

### Viewing Branch-Specific History

Let's examine the commit history on dev branch:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Commit History on Dev Branch"
[02:45:36 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git log
commit 87de0f7ad3b2e2f1e68e2f17fe1c2a559a87ce24 (HEAD -> dev)
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Oct 19 02:45:34 2025 +0500

    added third.txt

commit 8c331caa10309fcb76a8cbd38c4f2e8cbff80b64 (hello/master, master)
Author: Owais Abbasi <81351747+owais-io@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 30 23:47:49 2025 +0500

    Update second.txt on github

commit 4a130bb7b63436556220809afcaefe58260d7c45
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 30 23:43:25 2025 +0500

    updated second.txt

commit a38542e836ebbc1e75179c3b6b6c064efb72b8cd
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 30 23:30:38 2025 +0500

    updated first.txt and added second.txt

commit 303fea0985b17714f6f3ed934684a653e11c6578
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 30 23:28:12 2025 +0500

    added first.txt
```

**Understanding the References:**
- **(HEAD -> dev)** - Current position on dev branch
- **(hello/master, master)** - Where master and remote master branches point
- **New commit 87de0f7** - Exists only on dev branch
- **Branch divergence**: Dev has one more commit than master

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-50 to-pink-50 dark:from-purple-900 dark:to-pink-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Visual Branch Representation:**
```
master:  A -- B -- C -- D
                        ^
                        master (local)
                        hello/master (remote)

dev:     A -- B -- C -- D -- E
                             ^
                             HEAD -> dev

Where:
A = "added first.txt"
B = "updated first.txt and added second.txt"
C = "updated second.txt"
D = "Update second.txt on github"
E = "added third.txt" (only on dev)
```

**Current State**: The dev branch has moved forward with a new commit, while master remains at the previous commit.

</div>

## üöÄ Pushing Branches to GitHub

### Understanding Remote Branch Tracking

Before pushing, let's check our remote configuration:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking Remote Configuration"
[02:46:37 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git remote -v
hello	https://github.com/owais-io/secondproject.git (fetch)
hello	https://github.com/owais-io/secondproject.git (push)
```

**Remote Configuration:**
- **Remote name**: "hello" (custom name, usually "origin")
- **fetch URL**: Where we pull changes from
- **push URL**: Where we push changes to

### Pushing a New Branch with Upstream Tracking

Let's push our dev branch to GitHub:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Pushing Dev Branch to GitHub"
[02:47:14 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git push -u hello dev
Username for 'https://github.com': owais-io
Password for 'https://owais-io@github.com':
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 317 bytes | 317.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
remote:

remote:      https://github.com/owais-io/secondproject/pull/new/dev
remote:
To https://github.com/owais-io/secondproject.git
 * [new branch]      dev -> dev
branch 'dev' set up to track 'hello/dev'.
```

**Command Breakdown:**
- `git push -u hello dev` - Pushes dev branch to remote "hello"
- `-u` or `--set-upstream` - Sets up tracking relationship
- **Authentication**: Prompts for GitHub username and Personal Access Token

**Push Output Analysis:**

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**GitHub's Helpful Message:**
```
Create a pull request for 'dev' on GitHub by visiting:
https://github.com/owais-io/secondproject/pull/new/dev
```

This URL allows you to create a pull request to merge dev into master on GitHub - we'll cover this in the next tutorial!

### Verifying Branch on GitHub

After pushing, you can verify the branch exists on GitHub:
- Navigate to your repository on GitHub
- Click the branch dropdown (usually shows "main" or "master")
- You should see "dev" listed as an available branch
- Switch to the dev branch to see `third.txt` that exists only in this branch
- The master branch will still have only 2 files (first.txt and second.txt)

## üîÄ Merging Branches Locally

### Switching to Master Branch

Let's switch back to master and merge our dev changes:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Switching to Master Branch"
[02:53:26 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'hello/master'.
```

**Checkout Confirmation:**
- Successfully switched to master
- Status shows synchronization with remote master

### Performing the Merge

```bash title="Terminal Session: Merging Dev into Master"
[02:53:35 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git merge dev
Updating 8c331ca..87de0f7
Fast-forward
 third.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 third.txt
```

**Merge Explanation:**
- `git merge dev` - Merges dev branch into current branch (master)
- **Fast-forward** - Clean merge without conflicts
- **Updating commit range**: Shows the commits being merged
- **1 file changed**: third.txt was added

**Understanding Fast-Forward:**
Since master hasn't changed since dev was created, Git can simply move the master pointer forward to include the dev commits. No merge commit is needed.

### Checking Post-Merge Status

```bash title="Terminal Session: Status After Merge"
[02:53:40 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'hello/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Status Analysis:**
- **On branch master** - Back on master branch
- **Ahead by 1 commit** - Local master has the merge that remote doesn't have yet
- **Helpful suggestion**: Git prompts us to push

### Viewing Post-Merge History

```bash title="Terminal Session: Log After Merge"
[02:53:48 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git log
commit 87de0f7ad3b2e2f1e68e2f17fe1c2a559a87ce24 (HEAD -> master, hello/dev, dev)
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Oct 19 02:45:34 2025 +0500

    added third.txt

commit 8c331caa10309fcb76a8cbd38c4f2e8cbff80b64 (hello/master)
Author: Owais Abbasi <81351747+owais-io@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 30 23:47:49 2025 +0500

    Update second.txt on github

[... previous commits ...]
```

**Key Observations:**
- **(HEAD -> master, hello/dev, dev)** - Local master and dev now point to same commit
- **(hello/master)** - Remote master is still one commit behind
- **Linear history**: Fast-forward merge maintains clean history

## üì§ Pushing Merged Changes

### Pushing Master to Remote

```bash title="Terminal Session: Pushing Merged Master"
[02:54:33 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'hello/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

[02:54:33 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git push hello master
Username for 'https://github.com': owais-io
Password for 'https://owais-io@github.com':
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
To https://github.com/owais-io/secondproject.git
   8c331ca..87de0f7  master -> master
```

**Push Analysis:**
- **Total 0** - Objects already on GitHub (we pushed them with dev branch)
- **8c331ca..87de0f7** - Commit range being updated
- **master -> master** - Local master pushed to remote master

**Verification on GitHub:**
After this push, GitHub's master branch will now also contain third.txt. Both master and dev branches on GitHub have the same content now.

## üì• Creating Branches on GitHub and Pulling Locally

### Creating a Branch Directly on GitHub

The session demonstrates creating a branch called "newtest" directly on GitHub's web interface:

**Steps to Create Branch on GitHub:**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the branch dropdown (shows current branch, e.g., "master")
3. Type the new branch name in the search box: "newtest"
4. When it shows "Create branch: newtest from 'master'", click it
5. The new branch is created on GitHub, based on the current branch you're viewing

### Detecting Remote Branches Locally

Let's see how Git detects new remote branches:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking for Remote Changes"
[03:01:23 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'hello/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

[03:01:34 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git pull
From https://github.com/owais-io/secondproject
 * [new branch]      newtest    -> hello/newtest
Already up to date.
```

**Pull Output Explanation:**
- **[new branch] newtest -> hello/newtest** - Git discovered a new remote branch
- **Already up to date** - No changes to current branch (master)
- **Remote tracking**: Git now knows about hello/newtest

### Checking Local Branches

```bash title="Terminal Session: Listing Branches After Pull"
[03:01:53 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git branch
  dev
* master
```

**Important Observation:**
- Only dev and master appear in local branches
- The newtest branch is **not** automatically created locally
- It exists as a remote tracking branch (hello/newtest) but not as a local branch yet

### Creating Local Branch from Remote

Let's create a local version of the newtest branch:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking Out Remote Branch"
[03:02:04 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'hello/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

[03:02:26 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git checkout newtest
branch 'newtest' set up to track 'hello/newtest'.
Switched to a new branch 'newtest'

[03:02:30 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git status
On branch newtest
Your branch is up to date with 'hello/newtest'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Checkout Magic:**
- `git checkout newtest` - Git is smart enough to know you want the remote branch
- **Automatic tracking setup**: Creates local branch and sets upstream automatically
- **"Switched to a new branch"**: Created local newtest tracking hello/newtest

### Verifying All Branches

```bash title="Terminal Session: All Branches Now Visible"
[03:02:51 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git branch
  dev
  master
* newtest
```

**Branch List:**
- Three local branches now exist
- ***** shows we're currently on newtest
- All branches are synchronized with their remote counterparts

## üíº Working on a Remote-Created Branch

### Making Changes on Newtest Branch

Let's add some changes to our new branch:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Modifying Files on Newtest"
[03:02:51 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ vim second.txt
[03:03:24 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ cat second.txt
working

working again

hello from remote repo on github

hello
```

**Changes Made:**
- Opened second.txt in vim
- Added a new line: "hello"
- File now has 4 lines of content

### Staging and Committing Changes

```bash title="Terminal Session: Committing on Newtest Branch"
[03:03:27 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git status
On branch newtest
Your branch is up to date with 'hello/newtest'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   second.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

[03:03:32 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git add .
[03:03:37 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git commit -m "updated second.txt"
[newtest 6d3aac9] updated second.txt
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

**Commit Analysis:**
- **[newtest 6d3aac9]** - Committed on newtest branch
- **1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)** - Added 2 new lines

### Checking Status Before Push

```bash title="Terminal Session: Status After Commit"
[03:03:46 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git status
On branch newtest
Your branch is ahead of 'hello/newtest' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Status Information:**
- **Ahead by 1 commit** - Local newtest has changes remote doesn't have
- Git suggests pushing to synchronize

### Pushing Branch Updates

```bash title="Terminal Session: Pushing Newtest Changes"
[03:03:51 centos9@vbox seconddemo]$ git push hello newtest
Username for 'https://github.com': owais-io
Password for 'https://owais-io@github.com':

```

**Push Success Indicators:**
- **Total 3 (delta 1)** - Sent 3 objects with 1 delta compression
- **Resolving deltas**: GitHub processed the changes
- **87de0f7..6d3aac9** - Commit range updated on GitHub
- **newtest -> newtest** - Local newtest pushed to remote newtest

### Verifying on GitHub

After this push:
- Navigate to the newtest branch on GitHub
- You'll see second.txt has the new "hello" line
- Master and dev branches remain unchanged (they don't have this modification)

## üéØ Understanding Branch Isolation

### Branch-Specific Content

One of the most powerful features of Git branches is **isolation**. Let's verify this:

**On newtest branch:**
- second.txt has 4 lines (including the new "hello" line)
- All three files exist (first.txt, second.txt, third.txt)

**On master branch:**
- second.txt would have 3 lines (without the "hello" modification)
- All three files exist

**On dev branch:**
- Same as master (they point to the same commit)

This demonstrates that **changes made on one branch don't affect other branches** until you explicitly merge them.

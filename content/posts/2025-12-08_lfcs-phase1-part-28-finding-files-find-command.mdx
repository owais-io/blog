You know how to create, move, and delete files. But what about **finding** them? In a Linux system with millions of files across complex directory trees, the `find` command is your search engine. It's one of the most powerful and essential commands for system administrators.

Understanding `find` is critical for the LFCS exam. You'll use it constantly for locating configuration files, finding large files consuming disk space, searching by modification time, and identifying security issues like files with incorrect permissions.

<Callout type="info">
🎯 **What You'll Learn**:
- Understanding find syntax and how it works
- Finding files by name with -name
- Finding by file type with -type
- Finding by size with -size
- Finding by modification time with -mtime
- Finding by permissions with -perm
- Suppressing permission errors with 2>/dev/null
- Combining find with other commands (-exec)
- Real-world file search scenarios

## Understanding the find Command

The `find` command **recursively searches** directory trees for files matching specified criteria.

### Basic Syntax

```bash
find [PATH] [OPTIONS] [TESTS] [ACTIONS]
```

**Components**:
- `PATH`: Where to search (default: current directory)
- `OPTIONS`: How to search
- `TESTS`: What to match (name, size, type, etc.)
- `ACTIONS`: What to do with matches (print, delete, execute)

### Simplest Example

```bash
$ find /etc -name "hosts"
/etc/hosts
/etc/avahi/hosts
```

---

## Finding by Name

### Exact Name Match

```bash
$ find / -name "hosts" 2>/dev/null
/tmp/hosts
/tmp/files/photos/avahi/hosts
/etc/hosts
/etc/avahi/hosts
```

**What happened**:
- Searched entire filesystem (`/`)
- Found files named exactly "hosts"
- `2>/dev/null` suppressed permission errors

### Wildcard Patterns

```bash
# Files starting with "hosts"
$ find / -name "hosts*" 2>/dev/null
/etc/hosts
/etc/hosts.equiv
/usr/share/man/man5/hosts.5.gz

# Files containing "hosts"
$ find / -name "*hosts*" 2>/dev/null
/etc/hosts
/.ssh/known_hosts
/usr/bin/sss_ssh_knownhostsproxy
```

### Case-Insensitive Search

```bash
$ find /etc -iname "HOSTS"
/etc/hosts
/etc/avahi/hosts
```

---

## Suppressing Errors with 2>/dev/null

### The Permission Problem

```bash
$ find / -name "hosts"
find: '/boot/efi/EFI/centos': Permission denied
find: '/boot/grub2': Permission denied
find: '/boot/loader/entries': Permission denied
# ... many permission errors ...
/etc/hosts
```

**Why?** As a regular user, you can't read many system directories.

### The Solution

```bash
$ find / -name "hosts" 2>/dev/null
/etc/hosts
/etc/avahi/hosts
```

**What `2>/dev/null` does**:
- `2>` redirects stderr (error messages)
- `/dev/null` is a "black hole" (discards everything)
- Result: Clean output with only matches

<Callout type="success">
💡 **Pro Tip**: Always use `2>/dev/null` when searching system-wide as a regular user. It makes output readable and prevents clutter.
</Callout>

## Finding by File Type

### The -type Option

```bash
# Find regular files
$ find /tmp -type f

# Find directories
$ find /tmp -type d

# Find symbolic links
$ find /etc -type l
/etc/bin -> usr/bin
/etc/lib -> usr/lib
```

**Common types**:
- `f` = regular file
- `d` = directory
- `l` = symbolic link
- `b` = block device
- `c` = character device
- `s` = socket
- `p` = named pipe

---

## Finding by Size

### The -size Option

```bash
# Find files larger than 2GB
$ sudo find / -size +2G 2>/dev/null
/proc/kcore
/var/log/journal/huge.log

# Find files exactly 1024 bytes
$ find /tmp -size 1024c

# Find files smaller than 10KB
$ find /home -size -10k
```

**Size units**:
- `c` = bytes
- `k` = kilobytes
- `M` = megabytes
- `G` = gigabytes

**Operators**:
- `+` = greater than
- `-` = less than
- (none) = exactly

---

## Finding by Time

### Modification Time (-mtime)

```bash
# Files modified in last 24 hours
$ find /var/log -mtime 0

# Files modified more than 7 days ago
$ find /home -mtime +7

# Files modified exactly 7 days ago
$ find /home -mtime 7
```

**Time options**:
- `-mtime` = modification time (days)
- `-atime` = access time (days)
- `-ctime` = status change time (days)
- `-mmin` = modification time (minutes)

### Real-World Example

```bash
# Find and delete logs older than 30 days
$ find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete
```

---

## Finding by Permissions

```bash
# Find setuid files (security check)
$ sudo find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/chsh
```

**Permission options**:
- `-perm 644` = exactly 644
- `-perm /644` = any of these bits set
- `-perm -644` = all these bits set

---

## Combining Conditions

### AND Logic (Default)

```bash
# Files named *.conf AND larger than 1MB
$ find /etc -name "*.conf" -size +1M
```

### OR Logic (-o)

```bash
# Files ending in .txt OR .log
$ find /home -name "*.txt" -o -name "*.log"
```

### NOT Logic (!)

```bash
# All files EXCEPT .txt
$ find /home ! -name "*.txt"
```

---

## Actions with -exec

### Execute Command on Each Match

```bash
# Delete all .tmp files
$ find /tmp -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;

# Show detailed info for each match
$ find /etc -name "*.conf" -exec ls -lh {} \;
```

**Syntax**:
- `{}` = placeholder for found file
- `\;` = end of command (must be escaped)

### Confirm Before Action

```bash
# Interactive deletion
$ find /tmp -name "*.bak" -ok rm {} \;
# Prompts: rm ... /tmp/file.bak?
```

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Find Large Files

```bash
# Find files larger than 100MB
$ find /home -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

### 2. Find Old Log Files

```bash
# Find logs older than 90 days
$ find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime +90
```

### 3. Find Empty Files/Directories

```bash
# Empty files
$ find /tmp -type f -empty

# Empty directories
$ find /tmp -type d -empty
```

### 4. Find by Owner

```bash
# Find all files owned by user
$ find /home -user centos9

# Find files owned by group
$ find /var -group apache
```

### 5. Security Audit

```bash
# Find world-writable files
$ find / -type f -perm -002 2>/dev/null

# Find files without owner
$ find / -nouser 2>/dev/null
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

<Callout type="success">
**Master These Concepts**:

1. **find searches recursively** from the starting path
2. **2>/dev/null** suppresses permission errors
3. **-name** finds by filename (exact or wildcard)
4. **-type** finds by file type (f/d/l)
5. **-size** finds by file size (+/- operators)
6. **-mtime** finds by modification time (days)
7. **-perm** finds by permissions
8. **Multiple tests = AND logic** by default
9. **-exec** runs commands on matches
10. **Test before using -delete!**

**Quick Decision Guide**:
- Know exact name → `-name "filename"`
- Know pattern → `-name "*.txt"`
- Need by size → `-size +100M`
- Need by time → `-mtime +30`
- Need by type → `-type f/d/l`

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- Docker installed and running on your system
- Basic understanding of Docker containers
- Familiarity with networking concepts (IP addresses, subnets)
- Understanding of Linux command-line tools

</div>

## üìã Step 1: Examining Default Docker Networks

Let's start by exploring the default networks that Docker creates automatically.

### Listing Available Networks

```bash title="List Docker Networks"
docker network ls
```

This command reveals Docker's default network configuration:

```bash
NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE
10acedb416a3   bridge    bridge    local
4014e1a64d4c   host      host      local
b84fc03ca6b5   none      null      local
```

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Network</th>
<th>Driver</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
<th>Use Case</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>bridge</strong></td>
<td>bridge</td>
<td>Default container network</td>
<td>Standard container-to-container communication</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>host</strong></td>
<td>host</td>
<td>Uses host network directly</td>
<td>High-performance applications, no isolation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>none</strong></td>
<td>null</td>
<td>No networking</td>
<td>Isolated containers with no network access</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Inspecting the Default Bridge Network

Let's examine the default bridge network configuration:

```bash title="Inspect Bridge Network"
docker network inspect bridge
```

This command returns detailed network information in JSON format:

```json

‚úÖ **Network Analysis**: The default bridge network provides a private IP range (172.17.0.0/16) with automatic IP assignment starting from 172.17.0.2 (the first IP after the gateway).
</Callout>

## üñ•Ô∏è Step 2: Creating Containers on the Default Network

Let's create containers and observe how they're assigned to the default network.

### Creating the First Container

```bash title="Create Nginx Web Server"
docker run -d --name web-server-1 nginx:alpine
```

Docker pulls the nginx:alpine image and creates the container:

```bash
Unable to find image 'nginx:alpine' locally
alpine: Pulling from library/nginx
9824c27679d3: Pull complete 
6bc572a340ec: Pull complete 
403e3f251637: Pull complete 
9adfbae99cb7: Pull complete 
7a8a46741e18: Pull complete 
c9ebe2ff2d2c: Pull complete 
a992fbc61ecc: Pull complete 
cb1ff4086f82: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:42a516af16b852e33b7682d5ef8acbd5d13fe08fecadc7ed98605ba5e3b26ab8
Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:alpine
51213765205e4a632912a3722149be9b1a2783040779aeb0876351962644716c
```

### Verifying Container Status

```bash title="Check Running Containers"
docker ps
```

Output confirms the container is running:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
51213765205e   nginx:alpine   "/docker-entrypoint.‚Ä¶"   2 seconds ago   Up 2 seconds   80/tcp    web-server-1
```

**Container Details:**

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>CONTAINER ID</strong></td>
<td>51213765205e</td>
<td>Shortened unique identifier</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>IMAGE</strong></td>
<td>nginx:alpine</td>
<td>Lightweight Alpine-based Nginx</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>PORTS</strong></td>
<td>80/tcp</td>
<td>Internal port 80 exposed (not published to host)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>STATUS</strong></td>
<td>Up 2 seconds</td>
<td>Container running for 2 seconds</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Inspecting Network After Container Creation

```bash title="Re-inspect Bridge Network"
docker network inspect bridge
```

The network now shows the attached container:

```json
"Containers": {
    "51213765205e4a632912a3722149be9b1a2783040779aeb0876351962644716c": {
        "Name": "web-server-1",
        "EndpointID": "9dcd879a713a7bff3bfb45b5588d23d0943df4d70c0fff01559da5b04105467d",
        "MacAddress": "62:a2:32:80:a0:09",
        "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.2/16",
        "IPv6Address": ""
    }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
üí° **IP Assignment**: Docker automatically assigned `172.17.0.2` to our first container, which is the first available IP after the gateway (172.17.0.1).
</Callout>

## üîÑ Step 3: Adding More Containers

Let's create additional containers to see how Docker handles multiple containers on the same network.

### Creating Additional Containers

```bash title="Create Second Web Server and Alpine Client" showLineNumbers
docker run -d --name web-server-2 nginx:alpine
docker run -d --name alpine-client alpine:latest sleep 3600
```

The Alpine client requires downloading a new image:

```bash
# web-server-2 output
7ea2cda4c9c913e65e43a64b8b1cb86c2b1538bed88f388f65872d611f32fec0

# alpine-client output  
Unable to find image 'alpine:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/alpine
9824c27679d3: Already exists 
Digest: sha256:4bcff63911fcb4448bd4fdacec207030997caf25e9bea4045fa6c8c44de311d1
Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
2b7034890c35344265b6cdfe8dde4237f45ecd59883267ecfa8d39c097ea89fc
```

### Verifying All Containers

```bash title="Check All Running Containers"
docker ps
```

All three containers are now running:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
2b7034890c35   alpine:latest   "sleep 3600"             8 seconds ago    Up 7 seconds              alpine-client
7ea2cda4c9c9   nginx:alpine    "/docker-entrypoint.‚Ä¶"   38 seconds ago   Up 38 seconds   80/tcp    web-server-2
51213765205e   nginx:alpine    "/docker-entrypoint.‚Ä¶"   2 minutes ago    Up 2 minutes    80/tcp    web-server-1
```

### Examining Network with Multiple Containers

```bash title="Inspect Updated Network"
docker network inspect bridge
```

The network now shows all three containers with sequential IP assignments:

```json
"Containers": {
    "2b7034890c35344265b6cdfe8dde4237f45ecd59883267ecfa8d39c097ea89fc": {
        "Name": "alpine-client",
        "EndpointID": "5a2c9627602d75a386dd0809e0663015698b51813246786d013f79ba0b3937d3",
        "MacAddress": "ca:c8:af:8c:bb:38",
        "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.4/16",
        "IPv6Address": ""
    },
    "51213765205e4a632912a3722149be9b1a2783040779aeb0876351962644716c": {
        "Name": "web-server-1",
        "EndpointID": "9dcd879a713a7bff3bfb45b5588d23d0943df4d70c0fff01559da5b04105467d",
        "MacAddress": "62:a2:32:80:a0:09",
        "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.2/16",
        "IPv6Address": ""
    },
    "7ea2cda4c9c913e65e43a64b8b1cb86c2b1538bed88f388f65872d611f32fec0": {
        "Name": "web-server-2",
        "EndpointID": "fdcbefb89413497565a69e11841d578255e4147d6003e9e005052a3b4a2e6369",
        "MacAddress": "4a:d0:70:40:e0:d4",
        "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.3/16",
        "IPv6Address": ""
    }
}
```

**IP Assignment Pattern:**

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Container</th>
<th>IP Address</th>
<th>MAC Address</th>
<th>Creation Order</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>web-server-1</strong></td>
<td>172.17.0.2</td>
<td>62:a2:32:80:a0:09</td>
<td>First</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>web-server-2</strong></td>
<td>172.17.0.3</td>
<td>4a:d0:70:40:e0:d4</td>
<td>Second</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>alpine-client</strong></td>
<td>172.17.0.4</td>
<td>ca:c8:af:8c:bb:38</td>
<td>Third</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Callout type="success">
‚úÖ **Sequential Assignment**: Docker assigns IP addresses sequentially starting from 172.17.0.2, with each container getting a unique MAC address automatically.
</Callout>

## üåê Step 4: Testing Container-to-Container Communication

Now let's test how containers communicate with each other using their assigned IP addresses.

### Finding Container IP Addresses

```bash title="Extract IP Address"
docker inspect web-server-1 | grep IPAddress
```

This command extracts IP information:

```bash
            "SecondaryIPAddresses": null,
            "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
                    "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
```

### Testing Network Connectivity with Ping

```bash title="Test Ping from Alpine Client to Web Server"
docker exec alpine-client ping -c 3 172.17.0.2
```

The ping test demonstrates successful connectivity:

```bash
PING 172.17.0.2 (172.17.0.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.17.0.2: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.135 ms
64 bytes from 172.17.0.2: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.092 ms
64 bytes from 172.17.0.2: seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.093 ms

--- 172.17.0.2 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.092/0.106/0.135 ms
```

**Ping Results Analysis:**

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Metric</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Packets Transmitted</strong></td>
<td>3</td>
<td>All requested packets were sent</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Packets Received</strong></td>
<td>3</td>
<td>All packets reached the destination</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Packet Loss</strong></td>
<td>0%</td>
<td>Perfect connectivity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Average Latency</strong></td>
<td>0.106 ms</td>
<td>Very low latency (sub-millisecond)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Testing HTTP Communication

Let's test HTTP connectivity between containers.

```bash title="Correct wget Command"
docker exec alpine-client wget -qO- http://172.17.0.2
```

This successfully retrieves the Nginx welcome page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
<style>
html { color-scheme: light dark; }
body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto;
font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>

<p>For online documentation and support please refer to
<a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
Commercial support is available at
<a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
</body>
</html>
```

<Callout type="success">
‚úÖ **Communication Success**: The alpine-client container successfully communicated with the nginx web server using HTTP, demonstrating that containers on the same bridge network can communicate freely using IP addresses.
</Callout>

### Network Isolation Characteristics

1. **Internal Communication**: Containers can communicate freely within the same network
2. **Automatic IP Assignment**: Docker handles IP allocation automatically
3. **MAC Address Generation**: Each container gets a unique MAC address
4. **Port Accessibility**: Container ports are accessible from other containers on the same network
5. **Host Isolation**: Containers are isolated from the host network by default

## üéØ Key Takeaways

<div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-green-50 to-blue-50 dark:from-green-900 dark:to-blue-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">

### ‚úÖ Bridge Network Fundamentals

1. **Default Behavior**: Containers automatically join the bridge network when no network is specified
2. **IP Management**: Docker assigns IP addresses sequentially starting from 172.17.0.2
3. **Communication**: Containers on the same network can communicate using IP addresses
4. **Isolation**: The bridge network provides isolation from the host while enabling container communication
5. **Service Discovery**: While IP-based communication works, it's not ideal for dynamic environments

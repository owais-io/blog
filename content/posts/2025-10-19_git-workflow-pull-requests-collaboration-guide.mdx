## üîÑ Introduction to Git Workflows

### What is Git Flow?

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 dark:from-blue-900 dark:to-indigo-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Git Flow**: A branching model designed for professional development teams that provides a robust framework for managing releases, features, and hotfixes.

**Real-World Analogy**: Think of Git Flow like a **manufacturing pipeline**:
- **Main/Master Branch**: The finished products ready for customers (production)
- **Dev Branch**: The assembly line where features come together (staging)
- **Feature Branches**: Individual workstations where specific components are built (development)

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Organized Development**: Clear structure for where different types of work happen
- ‚úÖ **Stable Production**: Main branch always contains stable, tested code
- ‚úÖ **Parallel Development**: Multiple features can be developed simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **Code Review**: Changes are reviewed before merging
- ‚úÖ **Easy Rollback**: Issues can be isolated and reverted easily

</div>

## üèóÔ∏è Setting Up a Git Flow Repository

### Creating the Repository on GitHub

Let's start fresh with a new repository specifically for demonstrating Git Flow:

**Steps Performed (as shown in the terminal session comments):**
1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository
2. Repository name: "demo-git-flow"
3. Add a description (optional but recommended)
4. Set visibility to **Public**
5. **Initialize with a README** - This time we DO want this
6. Click "Create repository"

<Callout type="info">
üí° **Why Initialize with README?**: For Git Flow demos, starting with a README creates an initial commit on the main branch, giving us a proper starting point for our workflow.
</Callout>

### Cloning the Repository

```bash title="Terminal Session: Cloning Git Flow Repository"
[03:16:08 centos9@vbox Repo]$ git clone https://github.com/owais-io/demo-git-flow.git
Cloning into 'demo-git-flow'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.

[03:18:41 centos9@vbox Repo]$ cd demo-git-flow/
```

**Clone Output Analysis:**
- **remote: Enumerating objects: 3** - GitHub sends initial files
- **Receiving objects: 100%** - Successfully downloaded
- **Result**: Full repository with README.md and all Git infrastructure

### Verifying Repository Contents

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking Cloned Repository"
[03:18:50 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ ls
README.md

[03:18:51 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ ls -al
total 4
drwxr-xr-x. 3 centos9 centos9  35 Oct 19 03:18 .
drwxr-xr-x. 6 centos9 centos9  97 Oct 19 03:18 ..
drwxr-xr-x. 8 centos9 centos9 163 Oct 19 03:18 .git
-rw-r--r--. 1 centos9 centos9  30 Oct 19 03:18 README.md
```

**Directory Contents:**
- **README.md** - Initial project file
- **.git/** - Git repository metadata (163 bytes of infrastructure)
- **Ready to work**: Full Git repository cloned and functional

## üìù Creating Initial Commits on Main Branch

### Understanding Main vs Master

The terminal session shows we're on the **main** branch (not master):

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking Current Branch"
[03:19:53 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	first.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

<div className="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Main vs Master - Important Context:**

**Historical Background:**
- Older Git versions used **"master"** as the default branch name
- In 2020, GitHub changed the default to **"main"** for new repositories
- Existing repositories can keep using "master" or rename to "main"

**Why the Change?**
The tech community moved toward more inclusive language. "Main" better represents the branch's purpose (the main line of development) without historical baggage.

**What This Means for You:**
- **New GitHub repos**: Default to "main"
- **Older repos**: May still use "master"
- **Functionally identical**: Both serve the same purpose
- **Commands work the same**: Just use the appropriate name for your repo

**How to Check Your Default:**
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

</div>

### Adding Files to Main Branch

Let's create some initial content:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Creating and Committing First File"
[03:18:57 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ vim first.txt
[03:19:51 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ cat first.txt
This is first change

[03:19:53 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	first.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

**File Creation:**
- Created `first.txt` with content: "This is first change"
- File is untracked (Git sees it but isn't tracking changes)

### Attempting to Commit Without Staging

This demonstrates a common beginner mistake:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Commit Without Staging (Error)"
[03:19:59 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git commit -m "added first.txt"
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	first.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

**Why This Failed:**
- **Untracked files aren't automatically staged**: Must use `git add` first
- **Git's helpful error**: Shows exactly what needs to be done
- **Two-step process**: Add ‚Üí Commit (always in this order)

### Correct Workflow: Stage Then Commit

```bash title="Terminal Session: Proper Staging and Committing"
[03:20:13 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git add .
[03:20:32 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git commit -m "added first.txt"
[main 60c5cf3] added first.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 first.txt

[03:20:35 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Success Indicators:**
- **[main 60c5cf3]** - Committed on main branch with hash 60c5cf3
- **1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)** - Added one file with one line
- **Ahead by 1 commit** - Local main has changes remote doesn't have

### Adding Second File

Let's add one more file to main:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Adding Second File"
[03:20:38 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ vim second.txt
[03:21:10 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	second.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

[03:21:14 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git add .
[03:21:18 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git commit -m "added second.txt"
[main c3cffdf] added second.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 second.txt

[03:21:30 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Status Changes:**
- **Ahead by 2 commits** - Two local commits not yet pushed to GitHub
- Both first.txt and second.txt are now committed

### Pushing to GitHub

```bash title="Terminal Session: Pushing Initial Commits"
[03:21:51 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git push
Username for 'https://github.com': owais-io
Password for 'https://owais-io@github.com':
Enumerating objects: 7, done.
Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 536 bytes | 536.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 6 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
To https://github.com/owais-io/demo-git-flow.git
   fafe251..c3cffdf  main -> main

[03:22:09 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Push Success:**
- **Total 6 objects** - All our changes sent to GitHub
- **fafe251..c3cffdf** - Commit range updated
- **Up to date** - Local and remote now synchronized

## üåø Creating Branch Structure on GitHub

### Creating the Dev Branch

Now let's create our development integration branch directly on GitHub:

**Steps to Create Dev Branch on GitHub:**
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the branch dropdown (currently showing "main")
3. Type "dev" in the search box
4. Click "Create branch: **dev** from '**main**'"
5. The dev branch is now created, identical to main

<Callout type="info">
üí° **Why Create on GitHub?**: Creating branches on GitHub is useful when setting up repository structure before developers start working. It ensures everyone has access to the branches immediately.
</Callout>

### Creating Developer Feature Branches

Following Git Flow, each developer should have their own feature branch created from dev:

**Steps to Create dev-owais Branch:**
1. Switch to the dev branch on GitHub (using the branch dropdown)
2. Type "dev-owais" in the branch search box
3. Click "Create branch: **dev-owais** from '**dev**'"
4. Feature branch created for developer "owais"

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- **Pattern**: `dev-<developer-name>` or `feature/<feature-name>`
- **Purpose**: Clearly identifies who is working on what
- **Examples**: dev-owais, dev-sarah, feature/login, feature/payment

## üì• Pulling Remote Branches Locally

### Detecting New Branches

Let's pull the branches we created on GitHub:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Pulling Remote Branches"
[03:28:07 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

[03:28:10 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git branch
* main

[03:28:23 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git pull
From https://github.com/owais-io/demo-git-flow
 * [new branch]      dev        -> origin/dev
 * [new branch]      dev-owais  -> origin/dev-owais
Already up to date.

[03:28:41 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git branch
* main
```

**Pull Output Analysis:**
- **[new branch] dev -> origin/dev** - Git discovered the dev branch
- **[new branch] dev-owais -> origin/dev-owais** - Git discovered the feature branch
- **Already up to date** - Main branch has no new commits
- **Local branches**: Still only shows main

**Important Understanding:**
Git now **knows about** the remote branches (they're in the remote tracking refs) but hasn't created local branches for them yet.

### Switching to Feature Branch

Let's check out the dev-owais branch:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking Out Feature Branch"
[03:28:47 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git checkout dev-owais
branch 'dev-owais' set up to track 'origin/dev-owais'.
Switched to a new branch 'dev-owais'

[03:28:58 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git branch
* dev-owais
  main

[03:29:00 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git status
On branch dev-owais
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/dev-owais'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Checkout Magic:**
- **Automatic local branch creation**: Git created dev-owais locally
- **Automatic tracking setup**: Linked to origin/dev-owais
- **Switched to new branch**: Now working on dev-owais

## üíª Working on Feature Branch

### Adding Feature Content

Let's add a new feature to our dev-owais branch:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Creating Feature File"
[03:29:00 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ vim third.txt
[03:29:27 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git add .
[03:29:30 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git commit -m "added third.txt"
[dev-owais eda1bb6] added third.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 third.txt

[03:29:42 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git push
Username for 'https://github.com': owais-io
Password for 'https://owais-io@github.com':
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 297 bytes | 297.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
To https://github.com/owais-io/demo-git-flow.git
   c3cffdf..eda1bb6  dev-owais -> dev-owais
```

**First Feature Commit:**
- Created third.txt with content: "hello this is third file"
- Committed on dev-owais branch
- Pushed to GitHub successfully

### Modifying Existing Files

Let's make another change:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Modifying Existing File"
[03:30:10 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ vim second.txt
[03:30:39 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ cat second.txt
this is second chang

hello updated second.txt

[03:30:41 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git add .
[03:30:51 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git commit -m "appended second.txt"
[dev-owais 4356c25] appended second.txt
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

[03:31:04 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git status
On branch dev-owais
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/dev-owais' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

[03:31:08 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git push
Username for 'https://github.com': owais-io
Password for 'https://owais-io@github.com':
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 305 bytes | 305.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
To https://github.com/owais-io/demo-git-flow.git
   eda1bb6..4356c25  dev-owais -> dev-owais
```

**Second Feature Commit:**
- Modified second.txt (appended new content)
- **3 insertions, 1 deletion** - Shows line changes
- Successfully pushed to remote

### Verifying Branch Isolation

Let's verify that changes are isolated to dev-owais:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking Branch Differences"
[03:31:34 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git checkout master
error: pathspec 'master' did not match any file(s) known to git

[03:31:40 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ ls
first.txt  README.md  second.txt  third.txt

[03:31:47 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ cat second.txt
this is second chang

hello updated second.txt

[03:31:47 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

[03:32:07 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ ls
first.txt  README.md  second.txt

[03:32:08 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ cat second.txt
this is second change
```

**Branch Isolation Confirmed:**
- **Error with 'master'**: This repo uses 'main' (not master)
- **On dev-owais**: 3 files (third.txt exists), modified second.txt
- **On main**: 2 files (third.txt doesn't exist), original second.txt
- **Perfect isolation**: Changes on dev-owais don't affect main

## üîÄ Understanding Pull Requests

### What is a Pull Request?

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-50 to-pink-50 dark:from-purple-900 dark:to-pink-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Pull Request (PR)**: A GitHub feature that lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch. It's a request to merge your code into another branch, with a review and approval process.

**Real-World Analogy**: Think of a pull request like **submitting an assignment for review**:
- You complete your work (commits on feature branch)
- You submit it for review (create pull request)
- Teacher reviews it (code review by team lead/peers)
- Teacher can approve, request changes, or reject (merge, comment, or close)
- Once approved, it goes into the grade book (merged into target branch)

**Key Components:**
- ‚úÖ **Source Branch**: Where your changes are (dev-owais)
- ‚úÖ **Target Branch**: Where you want changes to go (dev)
- ‚úÖ **Description**: Explanation of what changed and why
- ‚úÖ **Review Process**: Team can comment, approve, or request changes
- ‚úÖ **Merge Decision**: Accept or reject the changes

</div>

### Creating Your First Pull Request

**Steps to Create a Pull Request on GitHub:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the **"Pull requests"** tab
3. Click **"New pull request"** button
4. Select **base branch**: `dev` (where you want changes to go)
5. Select **compare branch**: `dev-owais` (your feature branch with changes)
6. Review the changes shown in green (you'll see "Able to merge" if no conflicts)
7. Click **"Create pull request"**
8. Add a meaningful title: "Dev-owais request pull to be merged in dev branch"
9. Add a description explaining your changes
10. (Optional) Assign reviewers from your team
11. Click **"Create pull request"**

**What GitHub Shows:**
```
Able to merge
These branches can be automatically merged.
```

This green message means:
- No merge conflicts exist
- Changes can be integrated automatically
- Safe to proceed with the merge

## üë• Pull Request Review Process

### Reviewing Pull Requests

When you (or a team lead) reviews a pull request, you can see:
- **Files changed**: Which files were modified
- **Commits**: All commits included in the pull request
- **Diff view**: Line-by-line comparison of changes

**Review Options:**
1. **Merge pull request** - Accept and integrate the changes
2. **Comment** - Ask questions or provide feedback
3. **Close pull request** - Reject without merging
4. **Request changes** - Ask for modifications before accepting

### Closing a Pull Request (Without Merging)

In our demonstration, the reviewer closes the first pull request:

**Steps Shown in Terminal Comments:**
1. Navigate to the pull request
2. Scroll down to find **"Close pull request"** button
3. Add a comment explaining why: "cannot merge"
4. Click **"Comment"** to submit
5. Click **"Close pull request"**
6. Status changes to **"Closed"** (not merged)

**Why Close Without Merging?**
- Code needs significant changes
- Feature no longer needed
- Conflicts with other work
- Quality standards not met

### Reopening and Creating New Pull Request

The session shows creating a second pull request:

**Steps:**
1. Click **"New pull request"** again
2. Select base: `dev`, compare: `dev-owais` (same as before)
3. Create the pull request with title and description
4. This time, it will be approved

**Result**: Now there are 2 pull requests visible:
- 1 **Open** (the new one)
- 1 **Closed** (the rejected one)

This demonstrates that pull request history is preserved on GitHub.

## ‚úÖ Merging Pull Requests

### Approving and Merging

The session demonstrates the approval process:

```bash
# Terminal comment indicates:
# this time click on "merge pull request" and "confirm merge"
```

**Steps to Merge Pull Request:**
1. Review all changes one final time
2. Click **"Merge pull request"** button
3. (Optional) Edit the merge commit message
4. Click **"Confirm merge"** button
5. Pull request status changes to **"Merged"**
6. The purple merged icon appears
7. Changes are now in the dev branch!

**Post-Merge State on GitHub:**
- **main branch**: 2 files (first.txt, second.txt)
- **dev branch**: 3 files (first.txt, second.txt, third.txt) + modifications
- **dev-owais branch**: 3 files (same as dev now)

### Creating Second-Level Pull Request

Following Git Flow, dev branch changes should eventually go to main:

**Steps for Dev ‚Üí Main Pull Request:**
1. Create a new pull request
2. Select base: `main`, compare: `dev`
3. Title: "merge dev to main branch"
4. Review all changes (will include everything from dev-owais)
5. Click "Create pull request"
6. Review and click "Merge pull request"
7. Click "Confirm merge"

**Result**: Main branch now has all the changes from dev (which included dev-owais changes).

This demonstrates the **Git Flow hierarchy**:
```
feature branch (dev-owais)
    ‚Üì Pull Request #1 (merged)
dev branch
    ‚Üì Pull Request #2 (merged)
main branch
```

## üîÑ Synchronizing Local Repository

### Checking Local Status

After merging on GitHub, local repository is out of sync:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Local Repository Before Sync"

**What We See:**
- **origin/main** and **origin/dev** point to the same old commit (c3cffdf)
- Local doesn't know about the merges that happened on GitHub
- Need to pull to synchronize

### Pulling Merge Commits

```bash title="Terminal Session: Pulling Remote Merges"
[04:09:59 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git pull
remote: Enumerating objects: 2, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 2 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (2/2), 1.76 KiB | 1.76 MiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/owais-io/demo-git-flow
   c3cffdf..65cf187  dev        -> origin/dev
   c3cffdf..a5928c5  main       -> origin/main
Already up to date.
```

**Pull Output Analysis:**
- **c3cffdf..65cf187 dev -> origin/dev** - Dev branch updated with merge commit
- **c3cffdf..a5928c5 main -> origin/main** - Main branch updated with merge commit
- **Already up to date**: dev-owais hasn't changed (we're already on latest)

**Important**: Git updated the **remote tracking refs** but didn't update our local dev and main branches yet.

### Updating Local Main Branch

```bash title="Terminal Session: Pulling Main Branch Updates"
[04:10:40 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 4 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

[04:10:54 centos9@vbox demo-git-flow]$ git pull
Updating c3cffdf..a5928c5

```

**Sync Success:**
- **Behind by 4 commits** - Git detected missing commits
- **Fast-forward** - Clean merge of remote changes
- **2 files changed** - third.txt added, second.txt modified
- **Now up to date** - Local main matches GitHub

## üë• Adding Collaborators

### How to Add Collaborators to GitHub Repository

The session mentions adding collaborators to enable team collaboration:

**Steps to Add Collaborators:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Click **"Collaborators"** in the left sidebar (under "Access")
4. Click **"Add people"** button
5. Enter the GitHub username or email of your collaborator
6. Select the correct user from the search results
7. Choose their permission level:
   - **Read**: View and clone
   - **Write**: Read + create branches and pull requests
   - **Admin**: Write + manage settings

**Invitation Process:**
- Collaborator receives an email notification
- They can accept or decline the invitation
- You can also copy an invitation link to send directly

**After Acceptance:**
- Collaborator can clone the repository
- They can create branches and push commits
- They can create pull requests
- Depending on permissions, they may be able to merge PRs

<Callout type="info">
üí° **Best Practice**: Add team members as collaborators with Write access. Reserve Admin access for project leads who need to manage repository settings.
</Callout>

## üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection Rules

### Understanding Branch Protection

The session mentions branch protection rules in the comments:

```bash
# Settings >> Branches >> Branch protection rules
# you can also add rules. explain it in detail and how to do it.
```

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-red-50 to-orange-50 dark:from-red-900 dark:to-orange-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Branch Protection Rules**: GitHub features that protect important branches from accidental or unauthorized changes.

**Why Branch Protection Matters:**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Prevent accidental deletions**: Can't delete protected branches
- üõ°Ô∏è **Require code reviews**: Force pull request reviews before merging
- üõ°Ô∏è **Enforce status checks**: Ensure tests pass before merging
- üõ°Ô∏è **Maintain code quality**: Prevent direct pushes to main/production
- üõ°Ô∏è **Control who can merge**: Restrict merge permissions

</div>

### Setting Up Branch Protection Rules

**Steps to Configure Branch Protection:**

1. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click **"Settings"** tab
   - Click **"Branches"** in the left sidebar

2. **Create Protection Rule:**
   - Click **"Add branch protection rule"** button
   - Enter branch name pattern: `main` (or use wildcards like `release/*`)

3. **Configure Protection Settings:**

4. **Save Protection Rule:**
   - Click **"Create"** or **"Save changes"** button
   - Rules are immediately enforced

### Recommended Protection Settings

**For Main/Production Branch:**
```
‚úÖ Require pull request reviews (1-2 approvals)
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date
‚úÖ Include administrators (enforce for everyone)
‚úÖ Restrict who can push (optional, for high-security)
‚ùå Allow force pushes (dangerous!)
‚ùå Allow deletions (protect the branch)
```

**For Dev/Staging Branch:**
```
‚úÖ Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date
‚ö†Ô∏è Include administrators (optional)
‚ùå Allow force pushes (generally avoid)
‚ö†Ô∏è Allow deletions (maybe for cleanup)
```

**For Feature Branches:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Usually no protection needed (temporary branches)
‚úÖ Delete after merging (keep repository clean)
```

### Testing Branch Protection

Once rules are set up, try to push directly to main:

```bash
# This will now fail if protection is enabled
git checkout main
echo "test" >> file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "direct commit"
git push origin main
# Error: Cannot push to protected branch
```

**Expected Error:**
```
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed
remote: error: Required status check "tests" is expected
remote: error: At least 1 approving review is required
```

This forces developers to use the pull request workflow!

# (edit files)
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature X"

# 4. Push feature branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/my-feature

# 5. Create pull request on GitHub (via web interface)
# - Base: dev
# - Compare: feature/my-feature

# 6. After PR is approved and merged on GitHub
# 7. Update local dev branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# 8. Delete feature branch (locally)

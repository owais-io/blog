Ever wondered how to create your own bash scripts but felt overwhelmed by the process? You're in the right place. Creating and executing bash scripts is one of the fundamental skills every Linux user should master, yet many beginners struggle with the basics of file permissions and script execution.

<Callout type="info">
üéØ **What You'll Learn**: In this hands-on guide, you'll discover:
- How to create a simple bash script from scratch
- The importance of the shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) line
- Different methods to execute bash scripts
- Understanding and managing file permissions with `chmod`
- Common execution errors and how to fix them

</Callout>

## üöÄ Getting Started with Bash Scripts

Bash scripts are simple text files containing a series of commands that the bash shell can execute. They're incredibly powerful for automating repetitive tasks, system administration, and building complex workflows.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 dark:from-blue-900 dark:to-indigo-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

### Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have:
- Access to a Linux terminal (CentOS, Ubuntu, or any Linux distribution)
- Basic familiarity with terminal commands like `ls`, `cat`, and `vi`
- Understanding of file system navigation

</div>

## üìù Step 1: Creating Your First Script

Let's start by creating a simple "Hello World" script. First, we'll create an empty file:

```bash
touch hello.sh
```

The `.sh` extension is a convention that indicates this is a shell script, though it's not strictly required for execution.

<Callout type="success">
‚úÖ **Best Practice**: Always use the `.sh` extension for bash scripts to make their purpose clear to other developers and system administrators.
</Callout>

## ‚úèÔ∏è Step 2: Writing the Script Content

Now let's edit our script using a text editor. We'll use `vi` in this example:

```bash
vi hello.sh
```

Inside the editor, add the following content:

```bash title="hello.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World!"
```

Let's break down what each line does:

### Understanding the Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)

The first line `#!/bin/bash` is called a "shebang" or "hashbang". It tells the system which interpreter to use when executing the script.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-50 to-orange-50 dark:from-yellow-900 dark:to-orange-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

### üîç Why the Shebang Matters

Without the shebang, the system might try to execute your script with the wrong interpreter. You can check your default shell with:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

Most Linux systems use `/bin/bash` by default, but it's always better to be explicit.

</div>

### The Echo Command

The `echo` command simply prints text to the terminal. It's one of the most basic and useful commands in shell scripting.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Step 3: Executing Your Script

There are two main ways to execute a bash script:

### Method 1: Using the Bash Command

```bash
bash hello.sh
```

This method works immediately because you're explicitly telling bash to interpret the file:

```bash
$ bash hello.sh
Hello World!
```

<Callout type="info">
üí° **How it works**: When you use `bash hello.sh`, you're passing the script as an argument to the bash interpreter. The file doesn't need execute permissions for this method.
</Callout>

### Method 2: Direct Execution (Requires Execute Permissions)

The more common method is to execute the script directly:

```bash
./hello.sh
```

However, if you try this immediately after creating the script, you'll encounter a permission error:

```bash
$ ./hello.sh
bash: ./hello.sh: Permission denied
```

## üîê Step 4: Understanding File Permissions

Let's examine why we got that permission error by checking the file permissions:

```bash
ls -l hello.sh
```

You'll see output similar to this:

```bash
-rw-r--r--. 1 centos9 centos9 32 Sep  4 13:08 hello.sh
```

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">

<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">

#### üìñ Understanding Permission Format
```
-rw-r--r--
```
- First character: File type (`-` = regular file)
- Next 3: Owner permissions (`rw-` = read, write)
- Next 3: Group permissions (`r--` = read only)
- Last 3: Others permissions (`r--` = read only)

</div>

<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">

#### üîç Permission Letters
- `r` = Read permission
- `w` = Write permission  
- `x` = Execute permission
- `-` = Permission not granted

</div>

</div>

Notice that there's no `x` (execute) permission for anyone. That's why we got the "Permission denied" error.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 5: Making Your Script Executable

To fix the permission issue, we need to add execute permissions using the `chmod` command:

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
```

Now let's check the permissions again:

```bash
ls -l hello.sh
```

You should see something like:

```bash
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 centos9 centos9 32 Sep  4 13:08 hello.sh
```

Notice the `x` permissions have been added! Now we can execute the script directly:

```bash
./hello.sh
```

And you'll see:

```bash
$ ./hello.sh
Hello World!
```

<Callout type="success">
üéâ **Success!** Your script now runs directly without needing to call `bash` explicitly.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Be cautious when adding execute permissions. Only make files executable when necessary, and consider who needs access to run them.
</Callout>

## üîÑ Complete Workflow Summary

Let's review the complete process from start to finish:

```bash title="Complete bash script creation workflow" showLineNumbers
# 1. Create the script file
touch hello.sh

# 2. Edit the script (using vi, nano, or any text editor)
vi hello.sh
# Add: #!/bin/bash
# Add: echo "Hello World!"

# 3. Check your shell (optional)
echo $SHELL

# 4. Test with bash command (works without execute permissions)
bash hello.sh

# 5. Try direct execution (will fail initially)
./hello.sh  # Permission denied

# 6. Check current permissions
ls -l hello.sh

# 7. Add execute permissions
chmod +x hello.sh

# 8. Execute the script directly
./hello.sh  # Success!
```

## üö® Common Pitfalls and Solutions

<details>
<summary><strong>Permission Denied Error</strong></summary>

**Symptoms**: `bash: ./script.sh: Permission denied`
**Cause**: Script file lacks execute permissions  
**Solution**: Add execute permissions with `chmod +x script.sh`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Command Not Found</strong></summary>

**Symptoms**: `bash: script.sh: command not found`
**Cause**: Trying to execute without `./` prefix or script not in PATH
**Solution**: Use `./script.sh` or move script to a directory in your PATH

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Bad Interpreter Error</strong></summary>

**Symptoms**: `bad interpreter: /bin/bash: no such file or directory`
**Cause**: Incorrect shebang path
**Solution**: Verify bash location with `which bash` and update shebang accordingly

</details>

## üéØ Key Takeaways

<div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-green-50 to-blue-50 dark:from-green-900 dark:to-blue-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">

### ‚úÖ Remember These Points

1. **Shebang is Essential**: Always start bash scripts with `#!/bin/bash`
2. **Two Execution Methods**: Use `bash script.sh` or make executable with `chmod +x`
3. **Permissions Matter**: Scripts need execute permissions for direct execution
4. **Use .sh Extension**: Follow the convention for clarity and organization
5. **Security First**: Only add necessary permissions and be mindful of who can execute your scripts

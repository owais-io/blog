When you run `git merge`, Git doesn't always do the same thing. Depending on your branch history, Git chooses between two merge strategies: fast-forward or three-way merge. Understanding the difference is crucial for maintaining a clean, readable Git history.

## The Two Types of Merges

```
FAST-FORWARD MERGE                    THREE-WAY MERGE
==================                    ================

Before:                               Before:

master: A---B                         master: A---B---E
             \                                     \
        dev:  C---D                          dev:   C---D

After:                                After:

master: A---B---C---D                 master: A---B---E-------M
             (HEAD)                                    \     /
                                                  dev:  C---D
        Just moves pointer!
                                              Creates merge commit M!
```

## Fast-Forward Merge Explained

A fast-forward merge happens when there's a **linear path** from your current branch to the target branch. Git simply moves the branch pointer forward.

### Setting Up the Scenario

Let's create a scenario for a fast-forward merge:

```bash
# Start on master
git checkout master
git log --oneline
```

**Output:**
```
a2464fe (HEAD -> master, hello/master) added fourth.txt
ce0024b Revert "added fourth.txt"
479cd2a updated second.txt
```

Now create a branch and make commits:

```bash
# Create and switch to dev branch
git branch dev
git checkout dev

# Make some commits on dev
echo "working to update fast forward" >> first.txt
git add .
git commit -m "updated first.txt"

echo "working to update fast forward" >> third.txt
git add .
git commit -m "updated third.txt"
```

### The Branch State Before Merge

```bash
git log --oneline
```

**Output:**
```
d4a741d (HEAD -> dev) updated third.txt
73cdf0c updated first.txt
a2464fe (hello/master, master) added fourth.txt
```

Visualized:

```
                       master
                          |
    a2464fe -----------> (no new commits on master)
       |
       +----> 73cdf0c ----> d4a741d
                              |
                             dev (HEAD)
```

Notice: master hasn't moved. There's a direct linear path from master to dev.

### Performing the Fast-Forward Merge

```bash
# Switch to master
git checkout master

# Merge dev
git merge dev
```

**Output:**
```
Updating a2464fe..d4a741d
Fast-forward
 first.txt | 1 +
 third.txt | 1 +
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

<Callout type="success">
**Key Output**: `Fast-forward` - This tells you Git didn't create a merge commit. It just moved the master pointer!
</Callout>

### After Fast-Forward Merge

```bash
git log --oneline
```

**Output:**
```
d4a741d (HEAD -> master, dev) updated third.txt
73cdf0c updated first.txt
a2464fe (hello/master) added fourth.txt
```

Visualized:

```
Before merge:                    After merge:

    a2464fe  (master)               a2464fe
       |                               |
       +----> 73cdf0c ----> d4a741d    +----> 73cdf0c ----> d4a741d
                               |                              |
                              dev                     dev, master (HEAD)
```

Both `master` and `dev` now point to the same commit. No new commit was created!

## Three-Way Merge (Merge Commit) Explained

A three-way merge happens when **both branches have new commits**. Git must create a new "merge commit" to combine them.

### Setting Up the Scenario

First, let's create divergent branches:

```bash
# Create a new branch from current master
git branch devtest
git checkout devtest

# Make a commit on devtest
vi Fourth.txt  # Add: "updated for merge commit"
git add .
git commit -m "updated fourth.txt for merge commit"
```

Now go back to master and make a different commit:

```bash
# Switch to master
git checkout master

# Make a commit on master
vi second.txt  # Add: "updated for merge commit"
git add .
git commit -m "updated second.txt for merge commit"
```

### The Branch State Before Merge

```
master log:
  03439a0 (HEAD -> master) updated second.txt for merge commit
  d4a741d (dev) updated third.txt

devtest log:
  41083cf (devtest) updated fourth.txt for merge commit
  d4a741d (dev) updated third.txt
```

Visualized:

```
                             03439a0  (master, HEAD)
                            /         "updated second.txt"
    d4a741d ---------------+
       |                    \
    "updated                 41083cf  (devtest)
    third.txt"                        "updated fourth.txt"
```

Both branches have diverged from their common ancestor (`d4a741d`).

### Performing the Three-Way Merge

```bash
# On master, merge devtest
git merge devtest
```

Git opens your editor for a merge commit message (default is fine):

```
Merge branch 'devtest'
```

**Output:**
```
Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
 Fourth.txt | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

<Callout type="info">
**Key Output**: `Merge made by the 'ort' strategy` - This tells you a merge commit was created. The 'ort' strategy is Git's default merge algorithm.
</Callout>

### After Three-Way Merge

```bash
git log --oneline
```

**Output:**
```
bdc2211 (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'devtest'
03439a0 updated second.txt for merge commit
41083cf (devtest) updated fourth.txt for merge commit
d4a741d (hello/master, dev) updated third.txt
73cdf0c updated first.txt
```

The full log shows the merge commit's parents:

```bash
git log
```

**Output (partial):**
```
commit bdc2211595e50ac397fea2cb8f4ce652a410224f (HEAD -> master)
Merge: 03439a0 41083cf
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 26 22:52:42 2026 +0500

    Merge branch 'devtest'
```

<Callout type="success">
**Notice**: `Merge: 03439a0 41083cf` - The merge commit has TWO parents! This is what makes it a merge commit.
</Callout>

### Visualizing the Merge Commit

```
Before merge:                      After merge:

    03439a0 (master)                   03439a0 --------+
   /                                  /                 \
  d4a741d                           d4a741d              bdc2211 (master)
   \                                 \                  /
    41083cf (devtest)                 41083cf ---------+
                                           (devtest)

                                    bdc2211 is the merge commit
                                    It has two parents: 03439a0 and 41083cf
```

## How Git Decides Which Merge Type

```
                    git merge feature-branch
                            |
            Can master reach feature-branch
              by moving forward only?
                            |
              +-------------+-------------+
              |                           |
             YES                          NO
              |                           |
       FAST-FORWARD                 THREE-WAY MERGE
    (just move pointer)          (create merge commit)
```

### The Key Question

Git asks: "Is there a direct path from the current branch tip to the target branch tip?"

- **Yes** → Fast-forward (no divergence)
- **No** → Three-way merge (branches diverged)

## Controlling Merge Behavior

### Force a Merge Commit (No Fast-Forward)

Even when fast-forward is possible, you can force a merge commit:

```bash
git merge --no-ff feature-branch
```

This creates a merge commit even for linear history:

```
Without --no-ff:                With --no-ff:

master: A---B---C---D          master: A---B-------M
             (moved)                        \     /
                                    feature: C---D
```

Why use `--no-ff`?
- Preserves feature branch history
- Makes it clear when features were merged
- Easier to revert entire features

### Force Fast-Forward Only

If you want to ensure no merge commit:

```bash
git merge --ff-only feature-branch
```

This fails if fast-forward isn't possible, rather than creating a merge commit.

## Reading Git Merge Output

### Fast-Forward Output

```
Updating a2464fe..d4a741d
Fast-forward                    <-- Type of merge
 first.txt | 1 +                <-- Files changed
 third.txt | 1 +
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

### Three-Way Merge Output

```
Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.  <-- Type of merge + strategy
 Fourth.txt | 2 ++                  <-- Files changed
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

## After Merging: Syncing Feature Branch

After merging `devtest` into `master`, the branches point to different commits:

```bash
# master has the merge commit
git log --oneline master
# bdc2211 (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'devtest'
# 03439a0 updated second.txt for merge commit

# devtest doesn't have master's changes
git log --oneline devtest
# 41083cf (devtest) updated fourth.txt for merge commit
```

To update `devtest` with the merge:

```bash
git checkout devtest
git merge master
```

**Output:**
```
Updating 41083cf..bdc2211
Fast-forward
 second.txt | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

Now both branches point to the merge commit!

## Visual Summary

```
FAST-FORWARD (Linear Path Exists)
=================================

    master         dev                    master, dev
       |            |                          |
       v            v                          v
    A--B    +    B--C--D      ==>      A--B--C--D

    No merge commit needed!


THREE-WAY MERGE (Divergent Paths)
=================================

    master    dev                      master
       |       |                          |
       v       v                          v
    A--B--E    C--D           ==>    A--B--E--M
        \     /                           \  |
         \   /                        dev  \ |
          \ /                          |    \|
     (diverged)                        C-----D

    Merge commit M has two parents!
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use `--no-ff` for Feature Branches

```bash
git merge --no-ff feature-x
```

This makes your history show when features were integrated.

### 2. Use Fast-Forward for Sync Operations

```bash
git merge --ff-only main
```

When pulling updates from main into your feature branch.

### 3. Clean Up After Merge

```bash
# Delete the merged feature branch
git branch -d feature-x
```

### 4. Write Good Merge Commit Messages

Instead of just "Merge branch 'feature'":

```
Merge branch 'feature-user-auth'

Adds user authentication with JWT tokens.
Includes login, logout, and session management.
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Regular merge (Git chooses type)
git merge branch-name

# Force merge commit
git merge --no-ff branch-name

# Force fast-forward only (fails if not possible)
git merge --ff-only branch-name

# Abort a merge in progress
git merge --abort

# See merge commits in log
git log --merges

# See graph of branches
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

## Summary

Understanding merge types helps you:

- **Read Git output**: Know what happened during merge
- **Control history**: Choose between clean linear history or preserved branch structure
- **Debug issues**: Understand why merge commits appear (or don't)
- **Work with teams**: Use appropriate strategies for different workflows

Fast-forward keeps history simple; merge commits preserve branch context. Choose based on your team's needs and workflow preferences!

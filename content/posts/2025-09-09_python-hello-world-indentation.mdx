Every programming journey begins with a simple "Hello, World!" program. In Python, this first program teaches you not just how to display text, but also introduces one of Python's most distinctive features: indentation-based code structure.

<Callout type="info">
üéØ **What You'll Learn**: In this hands-on tutorial, you'll discover:
- How to create and run your first Python program
- The importance of Python's indentation rules
- How to use conditional statements with proper formatting
- Common indentation errors and how to fix them
- Best practices for Python code structure and readability
- Using VS Code for Python development

</Callout>

## üöÄ Creating Your First Python Program

Let's start by creating a simple Python file and running your first program. This hands-on approach will give you immediate feedback and build confidence.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 dark:from-blue-900 dark:to-indigo-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- Completed the [Python Installation & Environment Setup](https://owais.io/blog/python-installation-setup-guide) tutorial
- Python 3 installed and working on your system
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
- Basic familiarity with terminal/command prompt

</div>

## üìù Step 1: Create Your Python File

Let's start by creating a Python file in your terminal:

```bash
touch hello.py
ls
```

You should see your newly created `hello.py` file listed in the directory.

<Callout type="success">
‚úÖ **File Extension**: Python files use the `.py` extension. This tells your system and editor that the file contains Python code.
</Callout>

## üíª Step 2: Open Your Development Environment

Open your current directory in VS Code (or your preferred editor):

```bash
code .
```

This command opens VS Code with your current directory, allowing you to edit the `hello.py` file directly.

## üéØ Step 3: Your First "Hello World" Program

Let's add some content to your Python file. Start with the classic "Hello World" program:

```python title="hello.py - Version 1" showLineNumbers
print("Hello world!")
```

Now run your program from the terminal:

```bash
$ python hello.py
Hello world!
```

üéâ **Congratulations!** You've just written and executed your first Python program!

### Understanding the print() Function

The `print()` function is one of Python's built-in functions that displays text to the console:

```python title="print-examples.py" showLineNumbers
# Basic print statement
print("Hello world!")

# Print with variables
name = "Alice"
print("Hello", name)

# Print multiple items
print("Hello", "world", "from", "Python!")

# Print with formatting
age = 25
print(f"I am {age} years old")
```

## üîÄ Step 4: Adding Conditional Logic

Now let's enhance our program by adding a conditional statement. Update your `hello.py` file:

```python title="hello.py - Version 2" showLineNumbers
if True:
    print("This will always print because the condition is true")
print("Hello world!")
```

Run the updated program:

```bash
$ python hello.py
This will always print because the condition is true
Hello world!
```

Notice how both lines are printed - the conditional statement executes first, then the regular print statement.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 5: Understanding Python Indentation

Here's where Python differs from many other programming languages. Let's intentionally create an indentation error to understand this crucial concept:

```python title="hello.py - Incorrect Indentation" showLineNumbers
if True:
print("This will always print because the condition is true")
print("Hello world!")
```

When you run this version:

```bash
$ python hello.py
  File "/home/centos9/Razzaq-Labs-II/random/hello.py", line 2
    print("This will always print because the condition is true")
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

<Callout type="error">
‚ùå **IndentationError**: This error occurs because Python expects the code inside the `if` block to be indented. Unlike other languages that use braces `{}`, Python uses indentation to define code blocks.
</Callout>

## üéØ Step 6: Fixing the Indentation

Let's fix the indentation error by properly indenting the code inside the `if` block:

```python title="hello.py - Correct Indentation" showLineNumbers
if True:
    print("This will always print because the condition is true")
print("Hello world!")
```

Now when you run the program:

```bash
$ python hello.py
This will always print because the condition is true
Hello world!
```

Perfect! The program runs without errors and produces the expected output.

## üìè Understanding Python's Indentation Rules

### Why Indentation Matters

Python uses indentation to determine which statements belong together in a block. This makes Python code highly readable but requires careful attention to spacing.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">

<div className="bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg">

#### ‚úÖ Correct Indentation
```python
if True:
    print("Inside if block")
    print("Also inside if block")
print("Outside if block")

for i in range(3):
    print(f"Loop iteration {i}")
    if i == 1:
        print("Special case")
print("After loop")
```

</div>

<div className="bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg">

#### ‚ùå Incorrect Indentation
```python
if True:
print("Missing indentation")

for i in range(3):
    print(f"Loop iteration {i}")
  print("Inconsistent indentation")

if True:
    print("First line")
        print("Too much indentation")
```

</div>

</div>

<Callout type="success">
‚úÖ **PEP 8 Standard**: Python's official style guide (PEP 8) recommends using 4 spaces for indentation. Most Python editors can be configured to follow this automatically.
</Callout>

## üö® Common Indentation Errors and Solutions

<details>
<summary><strong>IndentationError: expected an indented block</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Missing indentation after `:` (colon)

```python
# Wrong
if True:
print("Hello")

# Correct
if True:
    print("Hello")
```

**Solution**: Add 4 spaces before the code that should be inside the block.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Inconsistent indentation levels

```python
# Wrong
if True:
    print("First line")
  print("Wrong indentation")

# Correct
if True:
    print("First line")
    print("Correct indentation")
```

**Solution**: Ensure all lines at the same level use identical indentation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Mixing tabs and spaces for indentation

```python
# Wrong (mixing tabs and spaces - hard to see!)
if True:
    print("Using spaces")
	print("Using tab")

# Correct (consistent spaces)
if True:
    print("Using spaces")
    print("Also using spaces")
```

**Solution**: Configure your editor to show whitespace and use only spaces (4 spaces recommended).

</details>

## üéØ Key Takeaways

<div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-green-50 to-blue-50 dark:from-green-900 dark:to-blue-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">

### ‚úÖ Remember These Points

1. **Indentation is Syntax**: In Python, indentation is not just for readability - it's part of the language syntax
2. **4 Spaces Standard**: Use 4 spaces for each indentation level (PEP 8 recommendation)
3. **Consistency is Key**: All lines at the same level must have identical indentation
4. **Colon Indicates Block**: After `:` (colon), the next line should be indented
5. **Editor Configuration**: Set up your editor to help with consistent indentation

You can view files, but now you need to **edit** them. On Linux servers, especially minimal installations and emergency recovery systems, graphical editors aren't available. This is where **vi** (and its improved version **vim**) becomes essential. Every Linux system has vi/vim installed by default.

For the LFCS exam, you **must** know how to use vi/vim. You'll need to edit configuration files, create scripts, and modify system settings. While nano is easier for beginners, vi/vim is ubiquitous and understanding it is a core competency for system administrators.

<Callout type="info">
🎯 **What You'll Learn**:
- Why vi/vim is essential for system administrators
- Understanding vi/vim's modal editing concept
- The three modes: Normal, Insert, and Command-line
- Basic navigation (h, j, k, l, w, b, gg, G)
- Entering and exiting Insert mode
- Saving and quitting (:w, :q, :wq, :q!)
- Basic editing (delete, undo, redo)
- Searching and replacing text
- Working with lines (dd, yy, p)
- Using vimtutor for practice
- Essential vim commands for daily use

## Why vi/vim?

### The Reality of Linux Administration

```bash
# You're troubleshooting a server issue via SSH
# The system is in minimal mode, no GUI
# You need to edit /etc/fstab to fix boot issues
# What editor do you use?

$ vi /etc/fstab
# vi is ALWAYS available
```

**Why vi/vim is critical**:
- ✅ **Installed by default** on every Linux/Unix system
- ✅ **Works over SSH** with minimal bandwidth
- ✅ **Works in recovery mode** when GUI isn't available
- ✅ **Extremely powerful** for experienced users
- ✅ **Required knowledge** for LFCS certification

### vi vs vim

```bash
$ which vi
/usr/bin/vi

$ which vim
/usr/bin/vim
```

**Differences**:
- **vi**: Original editor from 1976, basic features
- **vim**: "Vi IMproved" (1991), enhanced with syntax highlighting, undo/redo, plugins

**Good news**: On modern Linux systems, `vi` is usually a symlink to `vim`:

```bash
$ ls -l /usr/bin/vi
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 3 Jun 25 2024 /usr/bin/vi -> vim
```

<Callout type="success">
💡 **For this tutorial**: We'll use `vim` but everything applies to `vi` as well. The commands we'll learn work on both.
</Callout>

## Understanding vim's Modal Nature

**This is the #1 concept to understand**: vim is a **modal editor**.

### What Does "Modal" Mean?

Unlike modern editors where you just start typing, vim has different **modes** for different tasks:

| Mode | Purpose | How to Enter |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Normal** | Navigate and execute commands | Press `Esc` (default mode when vim opens) |
| **Insert** | Type and edit text | Press `i`, `a`, `o`, `O` from Normal mode |
| **Visual** | Select text | Press `v`, `V`, `Ctrl+v` from Normal mode |
| **Command-line** | Execute commands (save, quit, search) | Press `:`, `/`, `?` from Normal mode |

### Why Modal Editing?

**Traditional editor thinking**:
```
Open file → Type → Save → Close
```

**vim thinking**:
```
Open file (Normal mode)
  ↓
Navigate to location (Normal mode)
  ↓
Enter Insert mode (press i)
  ↓
Type text
  ↓
Exit Insert mode (press Esc)
  ↓
Save and quit (:wq)
```

**Advantage**: Your hands never leave the home row. Navigation and commands use regular keys, not arrow keys or mouse.

---

## Getting Started with vim

### Opening a File

```bash
# Create/edit a file
$ vim myfile.txt

# Edit existing file
$ vim /etc/hosts

# Open at specific line
$ vim +10 myfile.txt

# Open in read-only mode
$ view myfile.txt
```

### What You See When vim Opens

```
~
~
~
~
~
~
~
"myfile.txt" [New File]
```

**Key observations**:
- The `~` characters indicate empty lines
- Status line at bottom shows filename
- Cursor is blinking in top-left
- You're in **Normal mode** (can't type yet!)

---

## Normal Mode: Navigation

When vim opens, you're in **Normal mode**. This is for navigation and commands, not typing.

### Basic Movement (The Arrow Keys Alternative)

Instead of arrow keys, vim uses:

```
    k (up)
    ↑
h ← ↓ → l
    j (down)
```

**Why h, j, k, l?**
- They're on the home row (faster than reaching for arrows)
- Historical: Vi was created on a keyboard without arrow keys

**Practice**:
```bash
$ vim practice.txt
# Press h, j, k, l to move around
# Notice cursor movement
```

### Word-Based Movement

```
w = move forward one word
b = move backward one word
e = move to end of current word
```

**Example**:
```
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
^
Cursor here

Press w → moves to "quick"
Press w → moves to "brown"
Press b → moves back to "quick"
Press e → moves to end of "quick"
```

### Line-Based Movement

```
0 = move to beginning of line
^ = move to first non-whitespace character
$ = move to end of line
```

### File-Based Movement

```
gg = go to first line
G  = go to last line
10G = go to line 10
```

---

## Insert Mode: Actually Typing Text

### Entering Insert Mode

From Normal mode, press one of these keys:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `i` | Insert before cursor |
| `a` | Insert **a**fter cursor |
| `I` | Insert at beginning of line |
| `A` | Insert at end of line |
| `o` | **O**pen new line below |
| `O` | **O**pen new line above |

### Your First Edit

```bash
$ vim myfile.txt
# You're in Normal mode
# Press i to enter Insert mode
# Notice bottom shows: -- INSERT --
# Type: Hello World
# Press Esc to return to Normal mode
```

**What you'll see**:
```
Hello World
~
~
-- INSERT --
```

<Callout type="warning">
⚠️ **Most Common Beginner Mistake**: Trying to type immediately when vim opens. Remember: vim opens in Normal mode. Press `i` first!
</Callout>

### Exiting Insert Mode

**Always press `Esc` to return to Normal mode**.

This is the most important key in vim. Your workflow:
```
Normal mode → i (enter Insert) → type text → Esc (back to Normal)
```

---

## Saving and Quitting

All save/quit commands are executed from **Command-line mode** (start with `:`).

### Basic Save and Quit Commands

From Normal mode (press Esc first if in Insert mode):

```
:w         Write (save) file
:q         Quit vim
:wq        Write and quit
:q!        Quit without saving (discard changes)
:wq!       Force write and quit
```

### Step-by-Step: Edit and Save a File

```bash
$ vim test.txt

# 1. Press i to enter Insert mode
# 2. Type: This is a test file
# 3. Press Esc to return to Normal mode
# 4. Type: :w (you'll see it at the bottom)
# 5. Press Enter
# Result: "test.txt" [New] 1L, 21C written

# 6. Type: :q
# 7. Press Enter
# Result: vim closes
```

### Common Scenarios

**Made changes and want to save**:
```
:w
```

**Made changes and want to save and quit**:
```
:wq
```

**Made mistakes and want to quit without saving**:
```
:q!
```

**vim won't let you quit**:
```
E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)
```
**Solution**: Either save (`:w`) or force quit (`:q!`)

---

## Basic Editing Commands

All of these work in **Normal mode**.

### Deleting Text

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `x` | Delete character under cursor |
| `X` | Delete character before cursor |
| `dd` | Delete entire line |
| `dw` | Delete word |
| `d$` | Delete from cursor to end of line |
| `d0` | Delete from cursor to beginning of line |

**Examples**:
```bash
# Original text:
The quick brown fox

# Cursor on 'q' in "quick"
# Press x → deletes 'q'
The uick brown fox

# Press dd → deletes entire line
(line disappears)
```

### Undo and Redo

```
u       = Undo last change
Ctrl+r  = Redo (undo the undo)
```

**Practice**:
```bash
$ vim test.txt
# Type some text in Insert mode
# Press Esc to Normal mode
# Press dd to delete line
# Press u to undo (line comes back)
# Press Ctrl+r to redo (line disappears again)
```

### Copy (Yank) and Paste

In vim terminology:
- **Copy** = Yank (y)
- **Paste** = Put (p)

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `yy` | Yank (copy) entire line |
| `yw` | Yank word |
| `p` | Put (paste) after cursor |
| `P` | Put (paste) before cursor |

**Example workflow**:
```bash
Line 1: Important text
Line 2: Other stuff

# Move cursor to Line 1
# Press yy (yanks the line)
# Move cursor to Line 2
# Press p (pastes below Line 2)

Result:
Line 1: Important text
Line 2: Other stuff
Line 1: Important text
```

### Deleting Multiple Lines

```
3dd = Delete 3 lines
5dd = Delete 5 lines
```

**How it works**: Number + command
```
d   = delete
dd  = delete line
3dd = delete 3 lines
```

Same pattern works for yank:
```
3yy = Yank 3 lines
```

---

## Searching Text

### Forward Search

From Normal mode:
```
/pattern
```

**Example**:
```bash
# In vim with this text:
The quick brown fox
jumps over the lazy dog

# Press: /fox
# Press Enter
# Cursor jumps to "fox"

# Press n to find next occurrence
# Press N to find previous occurrence
```

### Backward Search

```
?pattern
```

Searches backward from cursor position.

### Search Navigation

```
n = Next match (in same direction)
N = Previous match (opposite direction)
```

---

## Find and Replace

### Replace Single Character

```
r = Replace character under cursor
```

**Example**:
```
Word: cat
Cursor on 'c'
Press: rb
Result: bat
```

### Find and Replace (Substitute)

**Syntax**:
```
:s/old/new/        Replace first occurrence on current line
:s/old/new/g       Replace all occurrences on current line
:%s/old/new/g      Replace all occurrences in entire file
:%s/old/new/gc     Replace all with confirmation
```

**Examples**:
```bash
# Replace "cat" with "dog" on current line
:s/cat/dog/

# Replace all "cat" with "dog" in entire file
:%s/cat/dog/g

# Replace with confirmation (asks yes/no for each)
:%s/cat/dog/gc
```

---

## Visual Mode: Selecting Text

### Entering Visual Mode

From Normal mode:

```
v       = Character-wise visual mode
V       = Line-wise visual mode
Ctrl+v  = Block visual mode
```

### Visual Mode Workflow

```bash
1. Enter visual mode (press v)
2. Move cursor to extend selection
3. Perform operation (d, y, etc.)
```

**Example**:
```bash
The quick brown fox

# Move cursor to 'q' in "quick"
# Press v (enter visual mode)
# Press w w (select "quick brown")
# Press d (delete selection)

Result:
The fox
```

---

## Line Numbers

### Show Line Numbers

```
:set number
```

**Shorthand**:
```
:se nu
```

### Hide Line Numbers

```
:set nonumber
```

**What you see**:
```
  1 Line one
  2 Line two
  3 Line three
```

### Jump to Specific Line

```
:10         Go to line 10
10G         Go to line 10 (from Normal mode)
```

---

## vimtutor: The Best Way to Learn

vim comes with an interactive tutorial.

### Starting vimtutor

```bash
$ vimtutor
```

**What you get**:
```
===============================================================================
=    W e l c o m e   t o   t h e   V I M   T u t o r    -    Version 1.7    =
===============================================================================
     Vim is a very powerful editor that has many commands, too many to
     explain in a tutor such as this.  This tutor is designed to describe
     enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as
     an all-purpose editor.

     The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 30 minutes,
     depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.
```

**Why vimtutor is excellent**:
- ✅ Interactive (you actually practice on the file)
- ✅ Safe (it's a copy, can't break anything)
- ✅ Comprehensive (covers all basics)
- ✅ Takes ~30 minutes
- ✅ Best way to build muscle memory

<Callout type="success">
💡 **Recommendation**: Run `vimtutor` at least once. It's the fastest way to become comfortable with vim.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### 1. Typing Immediately When vim Opens

**Symptom**: You type "hello" and strange things happen (h moves cursor left, e moves to end of word, etc.)

**Solution**: vim opens in Normal mode. Press `i` first!

### 2. Can't Exit vim

**Symptom**: You're stuck in vim and can't get out!

**Solution**:
```
1. Press Esc (ensure you're in Normal mode)
2. Type :q!
3. Press Enter
```

### 3. Made Changes and vim Won't Quit

**Symptom**:
```
E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)
```

**Solution**:
- Save then quit: `:wq`
- Discard changes: `:q!`

### 4. Accidentally Entered Replace Mode

**Symptom**: Everything you type overwrites existing text

**Cause**: You pressed `R` (Replace mode)

**Solution**: Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode

### 5. vim Is Beeping or Flashing

**Cause**: You're trying invalid commands (like pressing Esc repeatedly in Normal mode)

**Solution**: Just press `Esc` once and continue

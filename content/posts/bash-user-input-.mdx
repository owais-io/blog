Static scripts are useful, but truly powerful bash scripts respond to user input and adapt their behavior accordingly. Whether you're building configuration wizards, data collection tools, or interactive menus, capturing user input is an essential skill for any bash scripter.

<Callout type="info">
üéØ **What You'll Learn**: In this comprehensive guide, you'll discover:
- How to capture user input with the `read` command
- Different ways to prompt users for information
- Input validation techniques and best practices
- Building interactive menus and forms
- Handling different types of user input (text, numbers, choices)

**Time to read**: ~8 minutes | **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## üöÄ Understanding Interactive Scripts

Interactive scripts make your bash programs dynamic and user-friendly. Instead of hard-coding values or requiring command-line arguments, you can ask users for input during script execution, making your scripts more intuitive and flexible.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 dark:from-blue-900 dark:to-indigo-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

### Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have:
- Completed the [Bash Variables Guide](https://owais.io/blog/bash-variables-guide) tutorial
- Understanding of variable assignment and usage
- Familiarity with basic bash script creation

</div>

## üìù Your First Interactive Script

Let's start with a simple greeting script that asks for the user's name:

```bash title="greet_user.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash
echo "What is your name?"
read user_name
echo "Nice to meet you $user_name!"
```

When you run this script, here's what happens:

```bash
$ ./greet_user.sh
What is your name?
Yahya
Nice to meet you Yahya!
```

Let's break down what each line does:

### The Echo and Read Pattern

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">

<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">

#### üì§ Echo Command
```bash
echo "What is your name?"
```
- Displays a prompt to the user
- Creates clear communication
- Sets expectations for input

</div>

<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">

#### üì• Read Command
```bash
read user_name
```
- Pauses script execution
- Waits for user to type and press Enter
- Stores input in the `user_name` variable

</div>

</div>

<Callout type="success">
‚úÖ **How It Works**: The `read` command pauses your script and waits for the user to type something and press Enter. Whatever they type gets stored in the variable you specify.
</Callout>

## üõ†Ô∏è Read Command Variations

The basic `read` command is just the beginning. Let's explore different ways to capture user input:

### Inline Prompts

Instead of using separate `echo` and `read` commands, you can combine them:

```bash title="inline-prompt.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# Inline prompt with -p flag
read -p "What is your name? " user_name
read -p "How old are you? " age
read -p "What city are you from? " city

echo ""
echo "=== Your Information ==="
echo "Name: $user_name"
echo "Age: $age"
echo "City: $city"
```

Output:
```bash
$ ./inline-prompt.sh
What is your name? Alice
How old are you? 28
What city are you from? Seattle

=== Your Information ===
Name: Alice
Age: 28
City: Seattle
```

### Silent Input (Passwords)

For sensitive information like passwords, use the `-s` flag to hide input:

```bash title="secure-input.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Username: " username
read -sp "Password: " password
echo ""  # Add a newline since -s doesn't show the Enter

echo "Login attempt for user: $username"
# Note: Never echo passwords in real scripts!
```

<Callout type="warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: The `-s` flag hides the input from display, but the password is still stored in plain text in the variable. For production scripts, consider using more secure methods.
</Callout>

### Input with Timeouts

You can set timeouts to prevent scripts from hanging indefinitely:

```bash title="timeout-input.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

echo "Quick! You have 5 seconds to enter your name:"

if read -t 5 -p "Name: " quick_name; then
    echo "Hello $quick_name! You're quick!"
else
    echo ""
    echo "Too slow! Using default name: Guest"
    quick_name="Guest"
fi

echo "Welcome, $quick_name!"
```

### Reading Multiple Values

You can read multiple values at once:

```bash title="multiple-values.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter your first and last name:"
read first_name last_name

echo "Enter three favorite colors:"
read color1 color2 color3

echo ""
echo "Full Name: $first_name $last_name"
echo "Favorite Colors: $color1, $color2, $color3"
```

## üéØ Practical Interactive Scripts

### Example 1: Simple Calculator

```bash title="calculator.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Simple Calculator ==="
read -p "Enter first number: " num1
read -p "Enter second number: " num2

echo ""
echo "Choose operation:"
echo "1) Addition (+)"
echo "2) Subtraction (-)"
echo "3) Multiplication (*)"
echo "4) Division (/)"

read -p "Enter your choice (1-4): " choice

case $choice in
    1)
        result=$((num1 + num2))
        operation="+"
        ;;
    2)
        result=$((num1 - num2))
        operation="-"
        ;;
    3)
        result=$((num1 * num2))
        operation="*"
        ;;
    4)
        if [ $num2 -ne 0 ]; then
            result=$((num1 / num2))
            operation="/"
        else
            echo "Error: Cannot divide by zero!"
            exit 1
        fi
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid choice!"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

echo ""
echo "Result: $num1 $operation $num2 = $result"
```

### Example 2: File Manager Script

```bash title="file-manager.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Simple File Manager ==="
echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
echo ""

while true; do
    echo "What would you like to do?"
    echo "1) List files"
    echo "2) Create a file"
    echo "3) Delete a file"
    echo "4) Exit"
    
    read -p "Enter your choice (1-4): " choice
    echo ""
    
    case $choice in
        1)
            echo "Files in current directory:"
            ls -la
            ;;
        2)
            read -p "Enter filename to create: " filename
            if [ -n "$filename" ]; then
                touch "$filename"
                echo "File '$filename' created successfully!"
            else
                echo "Invalid filename!"
            fi
            ;;
        3)
            read -p "Enter filename to delete: " filename
            if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
                read -p "Are you sure you want to delete '$filename'? (y/N): " confirm
                if [[ $confirm =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
                    rm "$filename"
                    echo "File '$filename' deleted!"
                else
                    echo "Deletion cancelled."
                fi
            else
                echo "File '$filename' not found!"
            fi
            ;;
        4)
            echo "Goodbye!"
            exit 0
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid choice! Please try again."
            ;;
    esac
    echo ""
done
```

## üîç Input Validation Techniques

Always validate user input to make your scripts robust:

### Basic Validation

```bash title="input-validation.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# Validate non-empty input
while true; do
    read -p "Enter your name (required): " name
    if [ -n "$name" ]; then
        break
    else
        echo "Name cannot be empty! Please try again."
    fi
done

# Validate numeric input
while true; do
    read -p "Enter your age: " age
    if [[ $age =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] && [ $age -gt 0 ] && [ $age -lt 150 ]; then
        break
    else
        echo "Please enter a valid age (1-149)."
    fi
done

# Validate email format (basic)
while true; do
    read -p "Enter your email: " email
    if [[ $email =~ ^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$ ]]; then
        break
    else
        echo "Please enter a valid email address."
    fi
done

echo ""
echo "=== Validated Information ==="
echo "Name: $name"
echo "Age: $age"
echo "Email: $email"
```

### Choice Validation

```bash title="choice-validation.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

echo "Select your favorite programming language:"
echo "1) Bash"
echo "2) Python" 
echo "3) JavaScript"
echo "4) Go"

while true; do
    read -p "Enter your choice (1-4): " choice
    
    case $choice in
        1)
            language="Bash"
            break
            ;;
        2)
            language="Python"
            break
            ;;
        3)
            language="JavaScript"
            break
            ;;
        4)
            language="Go"
            break
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid choice! Please enter 1, 2, 3, or 4."
            ;;
    esac
done

echo "Great choice! $language is awesome!"
```

## üé® Building Interactive Menus

Create professional-looking menus for better user experience:

```bash title="advanced-menu.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

show_menu() {
    clear
    echo "================================="
    echo "    System Administration Menu   "
    echo "================================="
    echo "1) System Information"
    echo "2) Disk Usage"
    echo "3) Memory Usage"
    echo "4) Running Processes"
    echo "5) Network Information"
    echo "6) Exit"
    echo "================================="
}

while true; do
    show_menu
    read -p "Please select an option (1-6): " choice
    echo ""
    
    case $choice in
        1)
            echo "=== System Information ==="
            uname -a
            read -p "Press Enter to continue..."
            ;;
        2)
            echo "=== Disk Usage ==="
            df -h
            read -p "Press Enter to continue..."
            ;;
        3)
            echo "=== Memory Usage ==="
            free -h
            read -p "Press Enter to continue..."
            ;;
        4)
            echo "=== Top 10 Processes ==="
            ps aux | head -11
            read -p "Press Enter to continue..."
            ;;
        5)
            echo "=== Network Interfaces ==="
            ip addr show
            read -p "Press Enter to continue..."
            ;;
        6)
            echo "Thank you for using the system menu!"
            exit 0
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid option! Please try again."
            read -p "Press Enter to continue..."
            ;;
    esac
done
```

## üö® Common Pitfalls and Solutions

<details>
<summary><strong>Empty Input Handling</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Script breaks when user presses Enter without typing anything
**Solution**: Always check if input is empty before using it

```bash
read -p "Enter filename: " filename
if [ -z "$filename" ]; then
    echo "Filename cannot be empty!"
    exit 1
fi
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Special Characters in Input</strong></summary>

**Problem**: User input with spaces or special characters breaks the script
**Solution**: Always quote variables when using them

```bash
read -p "Enter path: " user_path
# Wrong
cd $user_path

# Correct  
cd "$user_path"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Infinite Loops</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Validation loops never exit when user keeps entering invalid input
**Solution**: Add a maximum retry limit

```bash
attempts=0
max_attempts=3

while [ $attempts -lt $max_attempts ]; do
    read -p "Enter valid input: " input
    if validate_input "$input"; then
        break
    fi
    attempts=$((attempts + 1))
    echo "Invalid input. Attempt $attempts of $max_attempts"
done

if [ $attempts -eq $max_attempts ]; then
    echo "Too many invalid attempts. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi
```

</details>

## üß™ Practice Exercise

Create a user registration script that demonstrates multiple input techniques:

```bash title="user-registration.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== User Registration System ==="
echo ""

# Full name with validation
while true; do
    read -p "Full Name: " full_name
    if [ -n "$full_name" ]; then
        break
    else
        echo "Name is required!"
    fi
done

# Email with basic validation
while true; do
    read -p "Email: " email
    if [[ $email =~ ^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$ ]]; then
        break
    else
        echo "Please enter a valid email!"
    fi
done

# Age with numeric validation
while true; do
    read -p "Age: " age
    if [[ $age =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] && [ $age -ge 18 ]; then
        break
    else
        echo "Please enter a valid age (18 or older)!"
    fi
done

# Password (hidden input)
read -sp "Password: " password
echo ""

# Confirm password
read -sp "Confirm Password: " confirm_password
echo ""

if [ "$password" = "$confirm_password" ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "=== Registration Successful ==="
    echo "Name: $full_name"
    echo "Email: $email"
    echo "Age: $age"
    echo "Account created successfully!"
else
    echo "Passwords don't match! Registration failed."
    exit 1
fi
```

## üéØ Key Takeaways

<div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-green-50 to-blue-50 dark:from-green-900 dark:to-blue-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">

### ‚úÖ Remember These Points

1. **Always Validate Input**: Never trust user input - validate everything
2. **Quote Variables**: Always use `"$variable"` to handle spaces and special characters
3. **Provide Clear Prompts**: Make it obvious what input you expect
4. **Handle Empty Input**: Check for empty strings before processing
5. **Use Timeouts When Appropriate**: Prevent scripts from hanging indefinitely

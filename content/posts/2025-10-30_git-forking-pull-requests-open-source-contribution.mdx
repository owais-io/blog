## 🍴 Understanding Forking

### What is Forking?

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 dark:from-blue-900 dark:to-indigo-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Forking**: A GitHub (and other Git hosting platforms) feature that creates a complete copy of someone else's repository under your own GitHub account. This is fundamentally different from cloning.

**Real-World Analogy**: Think of forking like **photocopying a recipe book**:
- **Original Repository**: The published cookbook in the library
- **Your Fork**: Your personal photocopy that you can write notes on and modify
- **Pull Request**: Suggesting your improvements back to the original author
- **Upstream**: The connection to the original cookbook for getting updates

**Key Point:** Forking is a **GitHub feature, not a Git command**. You can't "fork" using Git on the command line - it must be done through the GitHub web interface.

### Why Forking Exists

<div className="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**The Problem Forking Solves:**

Imagine you want to contribute to a popular open-source project like React or TensorFlow. You can't push directly to their repository - you don't have permissions! But you also need a way to:
1. Make your changes somewhere
2. Show those changes to the project maintainers
3. Request that they include your improvements

**The Solution: Forking provides:**
- ✅ Your own copy where you have full control
- ✅ A visible connection to the original project
- ✅ An easy way to propose changes back (pull requests)
- ✅ A preserved link to get updates from the original

**Common Open Source Workflow:**
```
1. Fork the project on GitHub
2. Clone YOUR fork to your computer
3. Make changes and commit
4. Push to YOUR fork
5. Create pull request from your fork to original
6. Maintainers review and potentially merge
```

## 🏁 Getting Started: The Spoon-Knife Practice Repository

### What is Spoon-Knife?

GitHub created a special repository specifically for practicing forking: **octocat/Spoon-Knife**

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-blue-50 dark:from-green-900 dark:to-blue-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Spoon-Knife Repository Details:**
- **URL**: https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
- **Owner**: octocat (GitHub's mascot)
- **Purpose**: Practice repository for learning forking
- **Unique Feature**: Thousands of forks and pull requests from learners worldwide
- **Safe to Practice**: Specifically designed for testing, so don't worry about making mistakes!

</div>

### Accessing the Spoon-Knife Repository

Let's begin the tutorial by navigating to the repository:

**Step 1: Navigate to Spoon-Knife**
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife**
3. Take a moment to explore the repository
   - Look at the README.md file
   - Notice the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
   - Check the huge number of existing forks!

<Callout type="info">
💡 **Interesting Fact**: The Spoon-Knife repository has tens of thousands of forks from people learning Git all over the world. You're joining a global community of learners!
</Callout>

## 🍴 Forking the Repository

### Locating the Fork Button

On the Spoon-Knife repository page:

**Visual Guide:**
1. Look at the top-right corner of the GitHub page
2. Find three buttons: **Watch**, **Fork**, and **Star**
3. The **Fork** button shows the current fork count
4. Click the **Fork** button

### Creating Your Fork

After clicking Fork:

**Fork Creation Process:**
1. GitHub shows a "Create a new fork" page
2. **Owner**: Automatically set to your GitHub username
3. **Repository name**: Defaults to "Spoon-Knife" (you can change if desired)
4. **Description**: Optional - "My practice fork of Spoon-Knife"
5. **Copy main branch only**: Usually checked (recommended for learning)
6. Click **"Create fork"** button

**What Happens:**
- GitHub creates a complete copy of Spoon-Knife under YOUR account
- The new repository URL: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife`
- GitHub remembers this is a fork (shows "forked from octocat/Spoon-Knife")
- You now have full control over this copy!

<Callout type="success">
✅ **Verification**: After forking, notice the banner at the top showing "forked from octocat/Spoon-Knife". This confirms your fork was created successfully!
</Callout>

## 📥 Cloning Your Fork Locally

### Getting Your Fork's URL

Now that you have your own fork on GitHub:

**Steps to Copy URL:**
1. Make sure you're on YOUR fork (check the URL - it should have YOUR username)
2. Click the green **"Code"** button
3. Ensure **HTTPS** is selected
4. Copy the URL (it will look like: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife.git`)

<Callout type="warning">
⚠️ **Critical**: Make sure you're cloning YOUR fork, not the original octocat/Spoon-Knife! Check that the URL contains YOUR username.
</Callout>

### Cloning to Local Machine

Now let's clone YOUR fork using the terminal:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Cloning Your Fork"
[23:35:07 centos9@vbox Repo]$ git clone https://github.com/owais-io/Spoon-Knife.git
Cloning into 'Spoon-Knife'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 10, done.
remote: Total 10 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 10 (from 1)
Receiving objects: 100% (10/10), done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
```

**Command Breakdown:**
- `git clone` - Git command to copy a repository
- `https://github.com/owais-io/Spoon-Knife.git` - URL of YOUR fork (not the original!)
- **Important**: Replace "owais-io" with YOUR GitHub username

### Entering the Cloned Repository

```bash title="Terminal Session: Navigating into Cloned Repository"
[23:36:23 centos9@vbox Repo]$ cd Spoon-Knife/
```

**Command Explanation:**
- `cd Spoon-Knife/` - Change directory into the newly cloned repository
- **Result**: Your terminal prompt should now show you're inside the Spoon-Knife directory

## 🔍 Exploring the Forked Repository

### Checking Repository Status

Let's verify everything is set up correctly:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking Initial Repository Status"
[23:38:47 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Status Output Analysis:**
- **"On branch main"** - Currently on the main branch
- **"up to date with 'origin/main'"** - Your local copy matches your fork on GitHub
- **"nothing to commit"** - No changes have been made yet
- **"working tree clean"** - No uncommitted changes

### Viewing Commit History

Let's see the existing commits in the repository:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Examining Commit History"

### Checking Current Branch

```bash title="Terminal Session: Viewing Branches"
[23:38:50 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git branch
* main
```

**Branch Output:**
- **`* main`** - The asterisk (*) indicates you're currently on the main branch
- This is the only local branch at the moment
- The original repository uses "main" as the default branch

### Examining Remote Configuration

```bash title="Terminal Session: Checking Remote Repositories"
[23:40:29 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/owais-io/Spoon-Knife.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/owais-io/Spoon-Knife.git (push)
```

**Remote Configuration Analysis:**
- **`origin`** - Default name for the remote repository you cloned from
- **`https://github.com/owais-io/Spoon-Knife.git`** - URL of YOUR fork (not the original)
- **`(fetch)`** - Used when pulling/fetching updates
- **`(push)`** - Used when pushing your changes

**Critical Understanding:**
When you clone YOUR fork, Git automatically sets YOUR fork as "origin". The original octocat/Spoon-Knife is NOT configured yet. We'll add it as "upstream" later!

### Viewing Repository Contents

```bash title="Terminal Session: Listing Repository Files"
[23:40:29 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ ls
index.html  README.md  styles.css
```

**Repository Files:**
- **index.html** - A simple HTML page
- **README.md** - Project description and information about forking
- **styles.css** - CSS styling for the HTML page

Let's look at the README:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Reading Repository README"
[23:44:17 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ cat README.md
### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
```

**README Content Highlights:**
- Explains what forking is
- Describes forks as a "bridge" between original and your copy
- Mentions Pull Requests as the way to contribute back
- Encourages practicing by submitting a PR
- Links to official GitHub forking guide

Perfect! The README itself explains forking - meta learning at its finest!

## ✏️ Making Changes to Your Fork

### Modifying the README

Let's add our own content to demonstrate that we can modify our fork:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Editing README File"
[23:44:38 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ nano README.md
```

**Editor Note:**
- Opens the README.md file in the nano text editor
- You can use any text editor you prefer (vim, emacs, VS Code, etc.)

After editing, let's see what we added:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Viewing Modified README"
[23:44:41 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ cat README.md

ADDED TESTING CHANGES FOR FORK
```

**What Changed:**
- Added a new line at the end: "ADDED TESTING CHANGES FOR FORK"
- This demonstrates we have full control over our fork
- Original repository is unaffected by our changes

## 📝 Committing Changes to Your Fork

### Staging the Modified File

```bash title="Terminal Session: Adding Changes to Staging Area"
[23:44:41 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git add .
```

**Command Explanation:**
- `git add .` - Stage all modified files in the current directory
- **Alternative**: Could use `git add README.md` to stage only the README
- **Purpose**: Prepare changes for committing

### Creating a Commit

```bash title="Terminal Session: Committing Changes"
[23:45:07 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git commit -m "updated readme"
[main 7536dd8] updated readme
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

**Commit Output Breakdown:**
- **`[main 7536dd8]`** - Commit created on main branch with hash 7536dd8
- **`updated readme`** - Commit message describing the change
- **`1 file changed`** - README.md was modified
- **`2 insertions(+)`** - Two lines were added (the new line + blank line)

**Important Understanding:**
This commit exists ONLY on your local machine right now. Neither your GitHub fork nor the original repository knows about it yet!

## 🚀 Pushing Changes to Your Fork

### Pushing to GitHub

Now let's send our commit to YOUR fork on GitHub:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Pushing to Your Fork"

<Callout type="success">
✅ **Success!** Your changes are now on YOUR fork on GitHub. You can verify by visiting `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife` in your browser.
</Callout>

### Verifying on GitHub

**Steps to Verify:**
1. Go to YOUR fork: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife`
2. Look at the README.md file on the GitHub website
3. You should see your added line: "ADDED TESTING CHANGES FOR FORK"
4. Notice the commit message "updated readme" appears in the commit history

**Important Observation:**
- YOUR fork has the changes
- The ORIGINAL octocat/Spoon-Knife does NOT have your changes
- This is the beauty of forking - you can experiment without affecting the original!

## 🔄 Creating a Pull Request from Your Fork

### Understanding Pull Requests from Forks

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-50 to-pink-50 dark:from-purple-900 dark:to-pink-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Pull Request from Fork**: A special type of pull request that proposes changes from YOUR fork back to the ORIGINAL repository.

**The Process:**
1. You make changes in your fork
2. You push those changes to your fork on GitHub
3. You create a pull request from your fork to the original
4. Original repository maintainers review your changes
5. They decide whether to merge your contributions

**Real-World Analogy**: Think of it like **submitting an article to a magazine**:
- **Your fork**: Your personal draft workspace
- **Your changes**: The article you wrote
- **Pull request**: Submission to the magazine editor
- **Review**: Editor reviews your submission
- **Merge**: Editor publishes your article (or rejects it)

</div>

### Navigating to the Original Repository

```bash
# Terminal comment indicates navigating back to original repo
# https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to the ORIGINAL repository: `https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife`
2. Look for the **"Pull requests"** tab at the top
3. Click on **"Pull requests"**

### Viewing Existing Pull Requests

When you click on the Pull requests tab, you'll see:

**What You'll Observe:**
- **Huge list of pull requests** - Thousands of learners have practiced here!
- Most are from forks (notice the fork icons)
- Many different usernames and changes
- This demonstrates the global learning community

<Callout type="info">
💡 **Learning Insight**: Don't be overwhelmed by the thousands of PRs. This repository is specifically designed for practice, so everyone's PRs accumulate here. In real projects, there would be far fewer.
</Callout>

### Initiating Pull Request Creation

**Steps to Start:**
1. Click the **"New pull request"** button (usually green)
2. GitHub shows the comparison page
3. **Important**: By default, it tries to compare branches within the same repo

### Comparing Across Forks

Here's the critical step that differs from regular pull requests:

**Finding "compare across forks":**
1. Look for the text **"compare across forks"** (usually near the branch selectors)
2. Click on **"compare across forks"**
3. This enables comparing your fork with the original repository

<Callout type="info">
💡 **Why This Option Exists**: GitHub knows the Spoon-Knife repository is frequently forked, so it provides this special option to easily create pull requests from forks back to the original.
</Callout>

### Selecting Source and Target Branches

After enabling "compare across forks", you'll see four dropdown menus:

**Branch Selection:**

<table className="w-full border-collapse border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 my-6">
  <thead>
    <tr className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800">

      <td className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 px-4 py-2">{`main`}</td>
      <td className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 px-4 py-2">Branch in your fork with changes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Visual Representation:**
```
Base: octocat/Spoon-Knife (main) ← Head: YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife (main)
      [Original Repository]              [Your Fork]
```

### Reviewing Your Changes

After selecting the branches, GitHub shows:

**Comparison View:**
- **"Able to merge"** - Green checkmark indicating no conflicts
- **Diff view** - Shows your additions in green
- **Files changed tab** - Lists all modified files (README.md in our case)
- **Commits tab** - Shows your "updated readme" commit

**Scroll down to see:**
- Exact lines you added (highlighted in green)
- Lines you removed (if any, highlighted in red)
- Context lines around your changes

### Creating the Pull Request

**Steps:**
1. Review your changes one final time
2. Click **"Create pull request"** button
3. A form appears for PR details

**Fill in Pull Request Details:**
- **Title**: "Testing fork pull request" or "Practice contribution from fork"
- **Description**: Explain your changes
  ```
  ## What I Changed
  Added a test line to the README as practice for the forking workflow.

  ## Purpose
  Learning how to contribute to open-source projects through forking.
  ```
4. Click **"Create pull request"** button

<Callout type="success">
🎉 **Pull Request Created!** You've successfully created a pull request from your fork to the original repository. You can now see your PR in the list with thousands of others!
</Callout>

![Pull Request Created](/images/pull-request-fork.png)

### Understanding Your Pull Request Status

After creating the PR, you'll see:

**Pull Request Page Shows:**
- **Status**: Open (waiting for review)
- **Your username and branch** → **Original repo and branch**
- **Merge status**: Whether it can be automatically merged
- **Conversation tab**: For discussion about the PR
- **Commits tab**: Your commits included in this PR
- **Files changed tab**: Diff view of all changes

**Important Reality Check:**
- The Spoon-Knife repository receives thousands of practice PRs
- Your PR will likely NOT be merged (and that's okay!)
- The repository is specifically for practice, not actual contributions
- The maintainers occasionally clean up old PRs

<Callout type="info">
💡 **Learning Purpose**: The goal here is to learn the workflow, not to actually contribute to Spoon-Knife. In real open-source projects, your meaningful contributions WILL be reviewed and potentially merged!
</Callout>

## 🔗 Understanding and Adding Upstream Remote

### What is Upstream?

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 dark:from-blue-900 dark:to-indigo-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Upstream Remote**: A Git remote that points to the ORIGINAL repository that you forked from.

**Current Setup:**
- **origin** → Your fork (e.g., `owais-io/Spoon-Knife`)
- **upstream** → Original repository (e.g., `octocat/Spoon-Knife`) - NOT SET YET

**Why You Need Upstream:**
- ✅ **Stay Updated**: Pull changes from the original project
- ✅ **Sync Your Fork**: Keep your fork in sync with upstream developments
- ✅ **Avoid Conflicts**: Reduce merge conflicts when creating PRs
- ✅ **Best Practice**: Standard workflow for fork-based development

**Analogy**: Think of upstream like **subscribing to updates**:
- **origin (your fork)**: Your personal notebook copy
- **upstream (original)**: The textbook that gets new editions
- **Syncing**: Updating your notebook when a new edition comes out

</div>

### Checking Current Remotes

Before adding upstream, let's see what we have:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Viewing Current Remote Configuration"
[00:06:48 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/owais-io/Spoon-Knife.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/owais-io/Spoon-Knife.git (push)
```

**Current State:**
- Only **origin** is configured
- Points to YOUR fork
- No connection to the original octocat/Spoon-Knife yet

### Getting Detailed Remote Information

```bash title="Terminal Session: Detailed View of Origin Remote"
[00:06:48 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/owais-io/Spoon-Knife.git
  Push  URL: https://github.com/owais-io/Spoon-Knife.git
  HEAD branch: main
  Remote branch:
    main tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    main merges with remote main
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    main pushes to main (up to date)
```

</table>

### Adding Upstream Remote

Now let's add the original repository as "upstream":

```bash title="Terminal Session: Adding Upstream Remote"
[00:07:06 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
```

**Command Breakdown:**
- `git remote add` - Command to add a new remote repository
- `upstream` - Name we're giving to this remote
- `https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git` - URL of the ORIGINAL repository

<Callout type="warning">
⚠️ **Important**: Make sure you're using the ORIGINAL repository URL (octocat/Spoon-Knife), not your fork!
</Callout>

### Understanding the "Upstream" Naming Convention

<div className="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Why "upstream"?**

The name "upstream" is a **convention, not a requirement**. Here's what you need to know:

**Technical Truth:**
- You COULD name it anything: `original`, `source`, `parent`, `central`, etc.
- Git doesn't care what you name remotes
- `git remote add thebigcheese https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git` would work

**Why "upstream" is Standard:**
1. **Industry Convention**: Virtually all developers use "upstream" for the original repo
2. **Intuitive Metaphor**: "Upstream" = source/origin of a river; changes flow downstream
3. **Documentation**: Most tutorials and documentation assume you use "upstream"
4. **Team Consistency**: Everyone understands what "upstream" means
5. **Tooling**: Some Git tools expect "upstream" naming

**River Analogy:**
```
[Upstream] Original Repository (source)
    ↓
[Downstream] Your Fork (water flows to you)
    ↓
[Local] Your Computer (final destination)
```

**Best Practice:** Always use "upstream" for the original repository. Your future self and collaborators will thank you!

**Common Remote Names:**
- **origin**: Your fork (or the repo you cloned from)
- **upstream**: The original repository you forked from
- **production**: Production deployment server (advanced use)
- **collaborator-name**: A colleague's fork (less common)

</div>

### Verifying Upstream Configuration

Let's check that upstream was added:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Verifying Upstream Remote"
[00:11:44 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/owais-io/Spoon-Knife.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/owais-io/Spoon-Knife.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git (push)
```

**Perfect Setup:**
- **origin** → Your fork (owais-io/Spoon-Knife)
- **upstream** → Original repo (octocat/Spoon-Knife)
- Both configured for fetch and push operations

### Examining Upstream Details

```bash title="Terminal Session: Detailed Upstream Information"
[00:11:44 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git remote show upstream
* remote upstream
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
  Push  URL: https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
  HEAD branch: main
  Remote branches:
    change-the-title new (next fetch will store in remotes/upstream)
    main             new (next fetch will store in remotes/upstream)
    test-branch      new (next fetch will store in remotes/upstream)
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    main pushes to main (fast-forwardable)
```

**Upstream Details Analysis:**

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Callout type="warning">
⚠️ **Important Note**: Even though the output shows push configuration for upstream, you typically **should NOT push directly to upstream**. You don't have permissions, and that's not the proper workflow. Always push to your fork (origin) and create pull requests!

## 🔄 Pulling Changes from Upstream

### Why Pull from Upstream?

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-blue-50 dark:from-green-900 dark:to-blue-900 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

**Scenario**: The original repository gets updates after you forked it. Your fork is now out of date.

**Real-World Examples:**
- Bug fixes added to the original project
- New features implemented by maintainers
- Security patches applied
- Documentation improvements

**Solution**: Pull changes from upstream to keep your fork current.

**Workflow:**
```
Original Repo (upstream) → Updates happen
         ↓
Your Fork (origin) ← You pull from upstream
         ↓
Local Clone ← You pull from origin
```

</div>

### Checking Current Status

```bash title="Terminal Session: Verifying Current Branch Status"
[00:15:55 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Status Indicates:**
- Currently on main branch
- Synchronized with YOUR fork (origin/main)
- No uncommitted changes
- **But**: Doesn't tell us about upstream!

### Fetching from Upstream

To see if upstream has changes:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Fetching Upstream Updates"
[00:17:35 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git fetch upstream
```

**Command Explanation:**
- `git fetch upstream` - Download updates from the original repository
- **Does NOT merge** - Just fetches the changes
- **Safe operation** - Won't modify your working files

**If there are changes**, you'll see output like:
```bash
From https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
 * [new branch]      new-feature -> upstream/new-feature
 * [new branch]      main        -> upstream/main
```

**If no changes** (or you're already current), you might see nothing, which is okay!

### Pulling from Upstream

To fetch AND merge changes:

```bash title="Terminal Session: Pulling from Upstream"
[00:17:35 centos9@vbox Spoon-Knife]$ git pull upstream main
```

**Command Breakdown:**
- `git pull` - Fetch and merge in one command
- `upstream` - Pull from the original repository
- `main` - Pull specifically the main branch

**Possible Outputs:**

**If there are updates:**
```bash
From https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating d0dd1f6..abc1234
Fast-forward
 README.md | 5 +++--
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

**If already up to date:**
```bash
From https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up to date.
```

### Complete Sync Workflow

**Full workflow to sync your fork:**

```bash title="Complete Fork Synchronization Workflow"
# 1. Fetch updates from upstream (original repo)
git fetch upstream

# 2. Make sure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# 3. Merge upstream changes into your local main
git merge upstream/main
# Or use pull (fetch + merge combined):
git pull upstream main

# 4. Push updated main to YOUR fork on GitHub
git push origin main
```

│  origin  │ → Your Fork (you/Spoon-Knife)       │
│ upstream │ → Original Repo (octocat/Spoon...)  │
└──────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘

Syncing with Upstream:
1. git fetch upstream          (Download updates)
2. git merge upstream/main     (Merge into local)
3. git push origin main        (Update your fork)
```

# INITIAL SETUP (Do Once)
# ============================================

# 1. Fork on GitHub (use web interface)
# Navigate to: https://github.com/original-owner/repo
# Click "Fork" button

# 2. Clone YOUR fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/repo.git
cd repo

# 3. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo.git

# 4. Verify remotes
git remote -v
# Should show:
# origin    → your fork
# upstream  → original repo

# ============================================
# REGULAR WORKFLOW (Repeat for Each Contribution)
# ============================================

# 5. Sync with upstream before starting work
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# 6. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 7. Make changes, commit
# (edit files)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add awesome feature"

# 8. Push to YOUR fork
git push origin feature/my-feature

# 9. Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Navigate to YOUR fork on GitHub
# Click "Compare & pull request"
# Fill in PR description
# Submit PR

# ============================================
# KEEPING FORK UPDATED
# ============================================

# Pull latest changes from upstream
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main

# Update feature branch with latest main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git merge main
# Or use rebase:
git rebase main

# ============================================
# AFTER PR IS MERGED
# ============================================

# Update local main
git checkout main

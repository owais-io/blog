### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Internet access for downloads
- Basic familiarity with opening terminal or command prompt
- Administrator/sudo privileges for software installation

</div>

## üì• Step 1: Download and Install Python 3

### Understanding Python Versions

Python 3 is the current and actively developed version of Python. Python 2 reached end-of-life in 2020, so always install Python 3.x for new projects.

<Callout type="success">
‚úÖ **Current Recommendation**: Install the latest stable version of Python 3 (currently 3.11.x or 3.12.x) unless you have specific compatibility requirements.
</Callout>

### Step 1.1: Download Python 3

1. **Visit the Official Python Website**
   - Go to [python.org](https://python.org)
   - Navigate to the **Downloads** section
   - The website automatically detects your operating system

2. **Select Your Version**
   - Click the large **Download Python 3.x.x** button for the latest version
   - For specific versions, scroll down to see all available releases

<div className="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

### üí° Version Selection Tips

- **Latest Stable**: Best for new learners and most projects
- **LTS (Long Term Support)**: Choose if you need long-term stability
- **Specific Version**: Only if required by your organization or specific libraries

</div>

### Step 1.2: Install Python 3

The installation process varies by operating system. Follow the instructions for your platform:

#### Windows Installation

```bash title="Windows Installation Steps"
# 1. Run the downloaded installer (.exe file)
# 2. IMPORTANT: Check "Add Python 3.x to PATH" checkbox
# 3. Click "Install Now" for default installation
# 4. Wait for installation to complete
# 5. Click "Close" when finished
```

<Callout type="warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Step**: Always check "Add Python 3.x to PATH" during Windows installation. This allows you to run Python from any command prompt location.
</Callout>

**Detailed Windows Steps:**

- Wait for the installation to complete

</div>

<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">

#### ‚ùå Common Mistakes
- Forgetting to check the PATH option
- Installing multiple Python versions without understanding the implications
- Canceling installation before completion

</div>

</div>

#### macOS Installation

```bash title="macOS Installation Steps"
# 1. Open the downloaded .pkg file
# 2. Follow the installation wizard
# 3. Click "Continue" through the setup screens
# 4. Enter your admin password when prompted
# 5. Click "Install" to begin installation
# 6. Click "Close" when installation completes
```

**macOS Additional Notes:**
- macOS comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed, but you should install Python 3 separately
- The installer will place Python 3 in `/Applications/Python 3.x/`
- Both `python3` and `python` commands may be available after installation

#### Linux Installation

For most Linux distributions, you can install Python 3 using the package manager:

```bash title="Ubuntu/Debian" showLineNumbers
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Python 3
sudo apt install python3

# Install pip (Python package manager)
sudo apt install python3-pip

# Install development tools (recommended)
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-venv
```

```bash title="CentOS/RHEL/Fedora" showLineNumbers
# For CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install python3 python3-pip

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip

# Install development tools
sudo dnf install python3-devel
```

```bash title="Arch Linux" showLineNumbers
# Install Python 3
sudo pacman -S python python-pip

# Install development tools
sudo pacman -S base-devel
```

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Verify Your Installation

### Step 2.1: Check Python Version

Open your terminal or command prompt and test your installation:

```bash title="Version Check Commands"
# Try this first (works on most systems)
python --version

# If the above doesn't work, try:
python3 --version

# You should see output like:
# Python 3.11.5
```

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">

<div className="bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg">

#### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
```bash
$ python --version

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>Python Command Not Found</strong></summary>

**Problem**: `'python' is not recognized` or `command not found: python`

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Windows: Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
# Or manually add Python to PATH:
# 1. Search "Environment Variables" in Windows
# 2. Edit PATH variable
# 3. Add Python installation directory

# macOS/Linux: Use python3 instead
python3 --version

# Create an alias for convenience
echo 'alias python=python3' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Multiple Python Versions Conflict</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Different versions of Python causing confusion

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check all Python installations
which python
which python3
whereis python

# Use specific version
python3.11 --version

# Use virtual environments (recommended)
python3 -m venv myproject
source myproject/bin/activate  # On Windows: myproject\Scripts\activate
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>VS Code Not Finding Python</strong></summary>

**Problem**: VS Code shows "Python interpreter not found"

**Solutions**:
```bash
# 1. Open VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
# 2. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
# 3. Choose the correct Python installation

# 4. Or manually set in settings.json:
{
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/bin/python3"
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Permission Denied Errors</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Permission errors when installing packages

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Use --user flag for pip installations
pip install --user package_name

# Or use virtual environments (recommended)
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install package_name
```

</details>

## üéØ Best Practices for Python Development

### Virtual Environments

Always use virtual environments for your projects:

```bash title="Virtual Environment Setup" showLineNumbers
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv my_project_env

# Activate the environment
# Linux/macOS:
source my_project_env/bin/activate

# Windows:
my_project_env\Scripts\activate

# Install packages in the virtual environment
pip install requests pandas

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

Made a mistake in a commit? Need to undo changes that have already been pushed? `git revert` is your safest option. Unlike destructive commands that erase history, `git revert` creates a new commit that undoes the changes - keeping your history intact and your team happy.

<Callout type="info">
**What You'll Learn**: In this comprehensive guide, you'll master:
- How `git revert` works and why it's safe
- The difference between `git revert` and `git reset`
- Reverting commits step-by-step with real examples
- Understanding the revert commit message format
- How revert affects local and remote repositories
- When to use revert vs other undo methods
</Callout>

## Why Revert Instead of Delete?

When you need to undo a commit, you have two main approaches:

```
Option A: DESTRUCTIVE (git reset)
================================
Before:  A---B---C---D  (D is the bad commit)
After:   A---B---C      (D is erased from history)

Option B: SAFE (git revert)
===========================
Before:  A---B---C---D      (D is the bad commit)
After:   A---B---C---D---E  (E undoes D's changes)
                       └── "Revert D"
```

<Callout type="success">
**Key Insight**: `git revert` doesn't remove history - it adds new history that undoes the old changes. This is crucial for shared repositories!

## Basic Git Revert Workflow

Let's walk through a real example. Here's our starting repository:

```bash
git log
```

**Output:**
```
commit 795429a1faa5bb77f9e3c052d32db92e62b008a7 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 26 14:37:37 2026 +0500

    added fourth.txt

commit 87de0f7ad3b2e2f1e68e2f17fe1c2a559a87ce24
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Oct 19 02:45:34 2025 +0500

    added third.txt

commit 8c331caa10309fcb76a8cbd38c4f2e8cbff80b64
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 30 23:47:49 2025 +0500

    Update second.txt on github
```

### The Current State

```
Commit History:
                                              HEAD
                                               |
    8c331ca ----> 87de0f7 ----> 795429a ----> master
       |            |              |
    "Update      "added        "added
    second.txt"  third.txt"   fourth.txt"
```

Let's say we need to undo the "added fourth.txt" commit (795429a).

### Step 1: Identify the Commit to Revert

You can use the commit hash (full or short):

```bash
# Full hash
git revert 795429a1faa5bb77f9e3c052d32db92e62b008a7

# Short hash (easier)
git revert 795429a
```

### Step 2: Execute the Revert

```bash
git revert 795429a
```

Git opens your default editor with a pre-filled commit message:

```
Revert "added fourth.txt"

This reverts commit 795429a1faa5bb77f9e3c052d32db92e62b008a7.

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
```

Save and close the editor to complete the revert.

**Output:**
```
[master ce0024b] Revert "added fourth.txt"
 1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)
 delete mode 100644 Fourth.txt
```

### Step 3: Verify the Revert

Check your files:

```bash
ls
```

**Before revert:**
```
first.txt  Fourth.txt  second.txt  third.txt
```

**After revert:**
```
first.txt  second.txt  third.txt
```

The `Fourth.txt` file is gone!

## Understanding the Revert Commit

Let's examine what `git revert` created:

```bash
git log
```

**Output:**
```
commit ce0024b5fc0365ab9830c94eee7be465b141a617 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 26 14:42:05 2026 +0500

    Revert "added fourth.txt"

    This reverts commit 795429a1faa5bb77f9e3c052d32db92e62b008a7.

commit 795429a1faa5bb77f9e3c052d32db92e62b008a7
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 26 14:37:37 2026 +0500

    added fourth.txt

commit 87de0f7ad3b2e2f1e68e2f17fe1c2a559a87ce24
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Oct 19 02:45:34 2025 +0500

    added third.txt
```

### What This Shows

```
Before Revert:

    87de0f7 ----> 795429a  (HEAD)
       |            |
    "added       "added
    third.txt"   fourth.txt"


After Revert:

    87de0f7 ----> 795429a ----> ce0024b  (HEAD)
       |            |              |
    "added       "added        "Revert
    third.txt"   fourth.txt"   added fourth.txt"

    The original commit (795429a) is PRESERVED!
    A new commit (ce0024b) UNDOES its changes.
```

<Callout type="info">
**Notice**: The original commit `795429a` is still in the history! We can see exactly what was done and when it was undone. This is the power of revert.
</Callout>

## Syncing the Revert with Remote

The revert only affected your local repository. To apply it to GitHub:

```bash
git push hello master
```

**Output:**
```
Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (2/2), 274 bytes | 274.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 2 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
To https://github.com/owais-io/secondproject.git
   479cd2a..ce0024b  master -> master
```

### After Push - Both Repos Match

```bash
git log
```

**Output:**
```
commit ce0024b5fc0365ab9830c94eee7be465b141a617 (HEAD -> master, hello/master)
Author: Owais Abbasi <owais.abbasi9@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 26 14:42:05 2026 +0500

    Revert "added fourth.txt"

    This reverts commit 795429a1faa5bb77f9e3c052d32db92e62b008a7.
```

Notice `hello/master` now points to the same commit as your local `master`.

## Revert vs Reset: A Visual Comparison

```
SCENARIO: Commits A-B-C-D exist, we want to undo D

============================================================
GIT REVERT (Safe - Adds History)
============================================================

Before:  A ----> B ----> C ----> D  (HEAD)

Command: git revert D

After:   A ----> B ----> C ----> D ----> E  (HEAD)
                                          |
                                   "Revert D"
                                   (undoes D's changes)

Result:
- D still exists in history
- E contains the opposite of D's changes
- Safe to push (no force required)
- Team members won't have conflicts

============================================================
GIT RESET --hard (Dangerous - Removes History)
============================================================

Before:  A ----> B ----> C ----> D  (HEAD)

Command: git reset --hard C

After:   A ----> B ----> C  (HEAD)

                          D is GONE!

Result:
- D is erased from history
- Requires force push (git push -f)
- Team members will have conflicts
- Audit trail is lost
```

## Reverting Multiple Commits

### Method 1: Revert One at a Time (Recommended)

```bash
# Revert the most recent commit
git revert HEAD

# Revert a specific commit
git revert abc123

# Revert another commit
git revert def456
```

Each revert creates its own commit, maintaining a clear history.

### Method 2: Revert a Range

```bash
# Revert commits from older to newer (exclusive..inclusive)
git revert older_commit..newer_commit
```

### Method 3: Revert Without Auto-Commit

If you want to revert multiple commits into a single commit:

```bash
# Stage the reverts without committing
git revert --no-commit abc123
git revert --no-commit def456

# Now commit all reverts together
git commit -m "Revert multiple commits: abc123 and def456"
```

## Common Revert Options

<table className="min-w-full border-collapse border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 my-6">
  <thead className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800">
    <tr>
      <th className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 px-4 py-2 text-left">Option</th>
      <th className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 px-4 py-2 text-left">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 px-4 py-2"><code>git revert &lt;commit&gt;</code></td>
      <td className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 px-4 py-2">Revert and auto-commit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 px-4 py-2"><code>git revert -n &lt;commit&gt;</code></td>
      <td className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 px-4 py-2">Revert but don't commit (stage only)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 px-4 py-2"><code>git revert --no-edit &lt;commit&gt;</code></td>
      <td className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 px-4 py-2">Revert with default message (no editor)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 px-4 py-2"><code>git revert -m 1 &lt;merge&gt;</code></td>
      <td className="border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 px-4 py-2">Revert a merge commit (specify parent)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Handling Revert Conflicts

Sometimes reverting causes conflicts (if later commits modified the same files):

```bash
git revert abc123
```

**Output:**
```
error: could not revert abc123... commit message
hint: after resolving the conflicts, mark them with
hint: "git add <file>" and run "git revert --continue"
```

### Resolve the Conflict

1. Open the conflicted file and resolve manually
2. Stage the resolution: `git add <file>`
3. Continue the revert: `git revert --continue`

Or abort the revert entirely:

```bash
git revert --abort
```

## Reverting a Revert

Yes, you can undo an undo! If you reverted something by mistake:

```bash
# Find the revert commit
git log --oneline

# Output:
# ce0024b Revert "added fourth.txt"
# 795429a added fourth.txt

# Revert the revert!
git revert ce0024b
```

This brings back the original changes.

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Check Before Reverting

```bash
# See what the commit changed
git show <commit-hash>

# See the diff
git diff <commit-hash>^ <commit-hash>
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Revert Messages

The default message is good, but you can add context:

```
Revert "added fourth.txt"

This reverts commit 795429a1faa5bb77f9e3c052d32db92e62b008a7.

Reason: File was added to wrong branch. Should be in feature-x.
```

### 3. Communicate with Your Team

Before reverting shared commits, let your team know:
- What you're reverting
- Why you're reverting it
- When you'll push the revert

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Basic revert
git revert <commit-hash>

# Revert without opening editor
git revert --no-edit <commit-hash>

# Revert without committing (stage only)
git revert -n <commit-hash>

# Revert a merge commit
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>

# Abort a revert in progress
git revert --abort

# Continue after resolving conflicts
git revert --continue
```

## Summary

`git revert` is the safest way to undo commits because it:

- **Preserves history**: The original commit stays visible
- **Creates audit trail**: Shows what was undone and when
- **Safe for teams**: No force push required
- **Reversible**: You can revert a revert

Use `git revert` when working with shared branches or when you need to maintain a complete history of all changes - including mistakes and their corrections!

## AWS EC2 Deployment (Free Tier)

I deployed this application on AWS EC2 to gain hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure management while keeping costs minimal.

### Instance Configuration
- **Instance Type**: t2.micro (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM)
- **AMI**: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
- **Storage**: 8GB gp3 SSD
- **Network**: VPC with Elastic IP for static addressing
- **Security**: Custom security group with SSH, HTTP, HTTPS access

### Setup Process

#### 1. **Server Provisioning**
- Launched EC2 instance via AWS Console
- Configured security groups with proper inbound/outbound rules
- Allocated and associated Elastic IP for consistent DNS mapping
- Set up SSH key pair for secure access

#### 2. **Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Updated system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Installed Node.js 18 LTS
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs -y

# Installed PM2 for process management
sudo npm install -g pm2

# Installed Nginx as reverse proxy
sudo apt install nginx -y

# Created 2GB swap space (critical for t2.micro with limited RAM)
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

#### 3. **Application Deployment**
```bash
# Cloned repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blog.git
cd blog

# Installed dependencies
npm install

# Built production bundle
npm run build

# Started app with PM2
pm2 start npm --name "blog" -- start
pm2 startup  # Configure PM2 to start on system boot
pm2 save
```

#### 4. **Nginx Configuration**
I configured Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward traffic from port 80/443 to the Next.js application running on port 3000:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name owais.io www.owais.io;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

#### 5. **SSL/TLS Setup**
```bash
# Installed Certbot
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y

# Obtained free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
sudo certbot --nginx -d owais.io -d www.owais.io

# Configured auto-renewal
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

#### 6. **DNS Configuration**
- Updated domain DNS records (A records) to point to EC2 Elastic IP
- Configured both root domain and www subdomain
- Waited for DNS propagation (10-15 minutes)

## ðŸ”„ CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

I implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline to streamline the deployment process and demonstrate modern DevOps practices.

### Pipeline Architecture

```

### Implementation Details

#### 1. **SSH Key Setup**
Generated dedicated SSH key pair on EC2 for GitHub Actions:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "github-actions" -f ~/.ssh/github_actions_key
cat ~/.ssh/github_actions_key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

#### 2. **GitHub Secrets Configuration**
Stored sensitive credentials securely in GitHub repository secrets:
- `EC2_SSH_KEY` - Private SSH key for authentication
- `EC2_HOST` - EC2 Elastic IP address
- `EC2_USER` - Ubuntu username

#### 3. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to EC2

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to EC2
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.EC2_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_KEY }}
          script: |
            cd ~/blog
            git pull origin main
            export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=1536"
            npm install
            npm run build
            pm2 restart blog
            pm2 save
```

#### 4. **Security Group Configuration**
Updated EC2 security group to allow SSH access from GitHub Actions runners:
- Port 22 (SSH): Open to 0.0.0.0/0 for GitHub Actions
- Port 80 (HTTP): Open to 0.0.0.0/0 (redirects to HTTPS)
- Port 443 (HTTPS): Open to 0.0.0.0/0

### Benefits of This CI/CD Setup

**Automated Deployments** - Push to main branch and changes go live automatically
**Zero Downtime** - PM2 performs graceful restarts
**Fast Iterations** - Typical deployment completes in 1-2 minutes
**Reduced Human Error** - Eliminates manual deployment steps
**Audit Trail** - Full deployment history in GitHub Actions logs
**Rollback Capability** - Can revert to previous commits if needed

## ðŸ”” Monitoring & Alerting with CloudWatch

To ensure high availability and immediate awareness of any issues, I implemented AWS CloudWatch alarms with SNS notifications.

### Setup Process

#### 1. **Create SNS Topic**
Created an SNS topic to receive and distribute alerts:
```bash
# Via AWS Console:
# SNS â†’ Topics â†’ Create topic
# Type: Standard
# Name: EC2-Instance-Down-Alert
```

#### 2. **Subscribe to Notifications**
Configured email notifications for instant alerts:
- Created email subscription to the SNS topic
- Confirmed subscription via email link
- Optional: Added SMS subscription for mobile alerts (format: +923001234567)

#### 3. **Configure CloudWatch Alarm**
Set up CloudWatch alarm to monitor instance health:
- **Metric**: `StatusCheckFailed` (Per-Instance)
- **Threshold**: Alert when â‰¥ 1
- **Period**: 5 minutes (free tier)
- **Action**: Send notification to SNS topic
- **Result**: Immediate email alert when instance goes down

### Monitoring Coverage

**Current Alarms:**
- **Instance Status Check** - Detects instance failures, stops, or crashes
- Triggers within 5-10 minutes of failure
- Email notification with instance details

**Additional Recommended Alarms:**
- High CPU Utilization (>80%) - Catch performance issues
- Low CPU Credit Balance (<20) - Prevent t2.micro throttling
- Disk Space Usage (>80%) - Requires CloudWatch agent
- Memory Pressure (>90%) - Requires CloudWatch agent

### Benefits
- **Immediate Awareness** - Know about issues within minutes
- **Proactive Response** - Address problems before users notice
- **Free Tier Friendly** - Basic monitoring included in AWS free tier
- **Uptime Tracking** - Historical data for reliability metrics

## Troubleshooting / Debugging

### 1. **Memory Constraints on t2.micro**
**Problem**: t2.micro instance has only 1GB RAM, which is insufficient for Next.js builds.

**Error Encountered**:
```
FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

**Solution**:
- Created 2GB swap space to supplement physical RAM
- Set `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=1536"` in deployment script
- Optimized build process to use available memory efficiently

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

### 2. **GitHub Actions SSH Authentication Failure**
**Problem**: First deployment attempt failed with SSH key parsing error.

**Error Encountered**:
```
2025/10/10 17:48:37 ssh.ParsePrivateKey: ssh: no key found
```

**Root Cause**: The private SSH key wasn't copied correctly to GitHub Secrets - missing characters or extra whitespace.

**Solution**:
- Regenerated the private key display: `cat ~/.ssh/github_actions_key`
- Carefully copied the **entire** key including `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`
- Updated the `EC2_SSH_KEY` secret in GitHub with the complete, unmodified key
- Ensured no extra spaces or line breaks were added during copy-paste

**Lesson Learned**: Always verify secret values are copied exactly as displayed in terminal.

### 3. **GitHub Actions Network Timeout**
**Problem**: After fixing the SSH key, deployment failed with connection timeout.

**Error Encountered**:
```
2025/10/10 17:54:49 dial tcp ***:22: i/o timeout
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

**Root Cause**: EC2 security group was configured to allow SSH only from "My IP", blocking GitHub Actions runners.

**Solution**:
- Updated EC2 security group inbound rules
- Added SSH (port 22) access from `0.0.0.0/0` to allow GitHub's dynamic runner IPs
- Maintained the rule allowing my personal IP for manual SSH access
- Configured proper descriptions for each rule to track their purpose

**Security Note**: While opening port 22 to all IPs is less restrictive, I mitigated risk by:
- Using SSH key authentication (no password authentication)
- Keeping the SSH key secure in GitHub Secrets
- Monitoring access logs regularly with `sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log`

### 4. **DNS Propagation Delay**
**Problem**: Domain didn't immediately point to EC2 instance after updating DNS records.

**Root Cause**: DNS caching at multiple levels (local machine, ISP, global DNS servers).

**Solution**:
- Verified DNS records were correctly set in GoDaddy (A record: `owais.io` â†’ `98.90.226.233`)
- Tested DNS propagation using: `nslookup owais.io 8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)
- Cleared local DNS cache on development machine
- Waited 10-15 minutes for global DNS propagation
- Verified EC2 was responding correctly to IP address before troubleshooting DNS

**Diagnostic Commands Used**:
```bash
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup owais.io
dig owais.io

# Test direct IP access
curl -I http://98.90.226.233

# Check global DNS propagation
# Used: https://dnschecker.org
```

### 5. **Zero-Downtime Deployments**
**Challenge**: Ensuring the site remains available during automated deployments.

**Solution**: Leveraged PM2's graceful restart capability
- PM2 automatically spawns new process before killing old one
- Configured `pm2 restart blog` instead of `pm2 stop` then `pm2 start`
- Used `pm2 save` to persist process list
- Set up `pm2 startup` to auto-restart on system reboot

**Result**: Achieved seamless deployments with no user-facing downtime.

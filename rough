Who I Am
Hey! I’m an AIOps and DevSecOps Engineer who loves making systems, cloud setups, and security smarter with AI. I see AIOps as taking everything — systems, cloud, deployments, security — and adding AI to automate it all. Not everyone may define it this way, but I think that’s where the industry is heading, and I’m excited to be part of it.

I didn’t start in tech at all — I used to be a Financial Accountant. Everything changed in 2020 when I read an article about AI in Dawn newspaper in Karachi. That one article hooked me. I started researching like crazy, bought my first Python course on Udemy, and slowly moved into tech. Fast forward to 2025, I’m a qualified AIOps Engineer with a UK Eduqual Level-6 diploma (same as a BSc Hons) and now I’m looking to start an MSc in Robotics so I can go deeper into AI and automation.

What I Do
I work across everything in modern infrastructure and automation — cloud, containers, security, scripting, you name it. I like experimenting and trying new things (sometimes it feels risky, but that’s how I grow).

Here’s what I usually work with:

Python and math for AI projects

Linux admin and Bash scripting

AWS & Azure cloud setups, plus Docker

AI-driven automation and monitoring

Securing DevOps pipelines end-to-end

Designing scalable systems and architecture

Why I Write
This blog is where I share my journey. I post tutorials, tips, and real-world lessons on AI, cloud, and operating systems. Writing helps me organize what I learn and hopefully makes things easier for anyone else learning the same stuff.

Beyond Code
When I’m not at my laptop, I’m usually reading about new tech, trying to contribute to open-source projects, or just exploring new places. I believe work-life balance matters and I’m always curious about how tech can make everyday life easier.
